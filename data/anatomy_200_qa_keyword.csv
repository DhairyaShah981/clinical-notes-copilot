What are the three major effects of stimulation of the heat-loss center?,"•Blood vessels in the skin begin to dilate allowing more blood from the body core to flow to the surface of the skin allowing the heat to radiate into the environment. •As blood flow to the skin increases, sweat glands are activated to increase their output. As the sweat evaporates from the skin surface into the surrounding air, it takes heat with it. •The depth of respiration increases, and a person may breathe through an open mouth instead of through the nasal passageways."
