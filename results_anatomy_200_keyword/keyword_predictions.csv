What is the pH of blood?,"['The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human\nurine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n59\nFIGURE 2.17\nThe pH Scale\nBuffers\nThe pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this\nslightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into\nthe bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids.', '(b) In aqueous solution, a base dissociates into hydroxyl ions (OH–) and\ncations. Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–.\nBases\nA base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+ already present in\nsolution (see Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine\nwith H+ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+ and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases\nrelease most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H+. Food\nmixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract\nafter the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3–), a weak base that attracts H+. Bicarbonate\naccepts some of the H+ protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.\nThe Concept of pH\nThe relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution’s pH is the negative, base-10\nlogarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+\nconcentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times\nmore acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH.', '35. Magnesium is an important element in the human\nbody, especially in bones.

Once dietary fats are digested and absorbed, why\ncan they not be released directly into the\nbloodstream?', 'These\ncompounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain\nboth hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and\ncushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a\nbyproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a\nreactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\nsolution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H+,\nthereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).\nThe pH of any solution is its relative concentration of\nH+. A solution with pH 7 is neutral. Solutions with pH\nbelow 7 are acids, and solutions with pH above 7 are\nbases. A change in a single digit on the pH scale (e.g.,\nfrom 7 to 8) represents a ten-fold increase or decrease\nin the concentration of H+. In a healthy adult, the pH of\nblood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45. Homeostatic control\nmechanisms important for keeping blood in a healthy\npH range include chemicals called buffers, weak acids\nand weak bases released when the pH of blood or\nother body fluids fluctuates in either direction outside\nof this normal range.\n2.5 Organic Compounds Essential to Human\nFunctioning\nOrganic compounds essential to human functioning\ninclude carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and\nnucleotides. These compounds are said to be organic\nbecause they contain both carbon and hydrogen.\nCarbon atoms in organic compounds readily share\nelectrons with hydrogen and other atoms, usually\noxygen, and sometimes nitrogen. Carbon atoms also\nmay bond with one or more functional groups such as\ncarboxyls, hydroxyls, aminos, or phosphates.\nMonomers are single units of organic compounds.

Muscle cells are excitable; they respond to a\nstimulus. They are contractile, meaning they can shorten and generate a pulling force. When attached between two\nmovable objects, in other words, bones, contractions of the muscles cause the bones to move. Some muscle\nmovement is voluntary, which means it is under conscious control. For example, a person decides to open a book\nand read a chapter on anatomy. Other movements are involuntary, meaning they are not under conscious control,\nsuch as the contraction of your pupil in bright light. Muscle tissue is classified into three types according to structure\nand function: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth (Table 4.2).', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.', 'Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands. Connective tissue, as its name implies, binds the\ncells and organs of the body together and functions in the protection, support, and integration of all parts of the\nbody. Muscle tissue is excitable, responding to stimulation and contracting to provide movement, and occurs as\nthree major types: skeletal (voluntary) muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle in the heart. Nervous tissue is\nalso excitable, allowing the propagation of electrochemical signals in the form of nerve impulses that communicate\nbetween different regions of the body (Figure 4.2).\nThe next level of organization is the organ, where several types of tissues come together to form a working unit.

The cells within a tissue share a\ncommon embryonic origin. Microscopic observation reveals that the cells in a tissue share morphological features\nand are arranged in an orderly pattern that achieves the tissue’s functions. From the evolutionary perspective,\ntissues appear in more complex organisms. For example, multicellular protists, ancient eukaryotes, do not have\ncells organized into tissues.\nAlthough there are many types of cells in the human body, they are organized into four broad categories of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands.', 'Each\ncell is spindle shaped with a single nucleus and no visible striations (Figure 4.18).\n148\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 4.18\nMuscle Tissue\n(a) Skeletal muscle cells have prominent striation and nuclei on their periphery.

These cells contain essentially the same\ninternal structures yet they vary enormously in shape and function. The different types of cells are not randomly\ndistributed throughout the body; rather they occur in organized layers, a level of organization referred to as tissue.\nThe micrograph that opens this chapter shows the high degree of organization among different types of cells in the\ntissue of the cervix. You can also see how that organization breaks down when cancer takes over the regular mitotic\nfunctioning of a cell.\nThe variety in shape reflects the many different roles that cells fulfill in your body.

What are the main parts of a nerve\ncell?\nNeurons display distinctive morphology, well suited to their role as conducting cells, with three main parts. The cell\nbody includes most of the cytoplasm, the organelles, and the nucleus. Dendrites branch off the cell body and appear\nas thin extensions. A long “tail,” the axon, extends from the neuron body and can be wrapped in an insulating layer\nknown as myelin, which is formed by accessory cells. The synapse is the gap between nerve cells, or between a\nnerve cell and its target, for example, a muscle or a gland, across which the impulse is transmitted by chemical\ncompounds known as neurotransmitters. Neurons categorized as multipolar neurons have several dendrites and a\nsingle prominent axon. Bipolar neurons possess a single dendrite and axon with the cell body, while unipolar\nneurons have only a single process extending out from the cell body, which divides into a functional dendrite and\ninto a functional axon. When a neuron is sufficiently stimulated, it generates an action potential that propagates\ndown the axon towards the synapse. If enough neurotransmitters are released at the synapse to stimulate the next\nneuron or target, a response is generated.\nThe second class of neural cells comprises the neuroglia or glial cells, which have been characterized as having a\nsimple support role. The word “glia” comes from the Greek word for glue. Recent research is shedding light on the\nmore complex role of neuroglia in the function of the brain and nervous system. Astrocyte cells, named for their\ndistinctive star shape, are abundant in the central nervous system. The astrocytes have many functions, including\nregulation of ion concentration in the intercellular space, uptake and/or breakdown of some neurotransmitters, and\nformation of the blood-brain barrier, the membrane that separates the circulatory system from the brain.']","The three main types of epithelial membranes are mucous membranes, which contain glands; serous membranes, which secrete fluid; and cutaneous membranes, which make up the skin."," Bone, Axial Skeleton, and Appendicular Skeleton"
What is the pH of blood?,"['The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human\nurine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n59\nFIGURE 2.17\nThe pH Scale\nBuffers\nThe pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this\nslightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into\nthe bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids.', '(b) In aqueous solution, a base dissociates into hydroxyl ions (OH–) and\ncations. Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–.\nBases\nA base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+ already present in\nsolution (see Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine\nwith H+ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+ and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases\nrelease most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H+. Food\nmixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract\nafter the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3–), a weak base that attracts H+. Bicarbonate\naccepts some of the H+ protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.\nThe Concept of pH\nThe relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution’s pH is the negative, base-10\nlogarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+\nconcentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times\nmore acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+.

Water is a lubricant and\ncushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a\nbyproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a\nreactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\nsolution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H+,\nthereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).\nThe pH of any solution is its relative concentration of\nH+. A solution with pH 7 is neutral. Solutions with pH\nbelow 7 are acids, and solutions with pH above 7 are\nbases. A change in a single digit on the pH scale (e.g.,\nfrom 7 to 8) represents a ten-fold increase or decrease\nin the concentration of H+. In a healthy adult, the pH of\nblood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45.

Muscle cells are excitable; they respond to a\nstimulus. They are contractile, meaning they can shorten and generate a pulling force. When attached between two\nmovable objects, in other words, bones, contractions of the muscles cause the bones to move. Some muscle\nmovement is voluntary, which means it is under conscious control. For example, a person decides to open a book\nand read a chapter on anatomy. Other movements are involuntary, meaning they are not under conscious control,\nsuch as the contraction of your pupil in bright light. Muscle tissue is classified into three types according to structure\nand function: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth (Table 4.2).', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.', 'Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands. Connective tissue, as its name implies, binds the\ncells and organs of the body together and functions in the protection, support, and integration of all parts of the\nbody. Muscle tissue is excitable, responding to stimulation and contracting to provide movement, and occurs as\nthree major types: skeletal (voluntary) muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle in the heart. Nervous tissue is\nalso excitable, allowing the propagation of electrochemical signals in the form of nerve impulses that communicate\nbetween different regions of the body (Figure 4.2).\nThe next level of organization is the organ, where several types of tissues come together to form a working unit. Just\nas knowing the structure and function of cells helps you in your study of tissues, knowledge of tissues will help you\nunderstand how organs function. The epithelial and connective tissues are discussed in detail in this chapter. Muscle\nand nervous tissues will be discussed only briefly in this chapter.\n126\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 4.2\nFour Types of Tissue: Body\nThe four types of tissues are exemplified in nervous tissue, stratified squamous epithelial\ntissue, cardiac muscle tissue, and connective tissue.

Muscle cells are excitable; they respond to a\nstimulus. They are contractile, meaning they can shorten and generate a pulling force. When attached between two\nmovable objects, in other words, bones, contractions of the muscles cause the bones to move. Some muscle\nmovement is voluntary, which means it is under conscious control. For example, a person decides to open a book\nand read a chapter on anatomy. Other movements are involuntary, meaning they are not under conscious control,\nsuch as the contraction of your pupil in bright light. Muscle tissue is classified into three types according to structure\nand function: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth (Table 4.2).', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.', 'Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands. Connective tissue, as its name implies, binds the\ncells and organs of the body together and functions in the protection, support, and integration of all parts of the\nbody. Muscle tissue is excitable, responding to stimulation and contracting to provide movement, and occurs as\nthree major types: skeletal (voluntary) muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle in the heart. Nervous tissue is\nalso excitable, allowing the propagation of electrochemical signals in the form of nerve impulses that communicate\nbetween different regions of the body (Figure 4.2).\nThe next level of organization is the organ, where several types of tissues come together to form a working unit. Just\nas knowing the structure and function of cells helps you in your study of tissues, knowledge of tissues will help you\nunderstand how organs function. The epithelial and connective tissues are discussed in detail in this chapter. Muscle\nand nervous tissues will be discussed only briefly in this chapter.\n126\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 4.2\nFour Types of Tissue: Body\nThe four types of tissues are exemplified in nervous tissue, stratified squamous epithelial\ntissue, cardiac muscle tissue, and connective tissue. (Micrographs provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School ©\n2012)\nEmbryonic Origin of Tissues\nThe zygote, or fertilized egg, is a single cell formed by the fusion of an egg and sperm. After fertilization the zygote\ngives rise to rapid mitotic cycles, generating many cells to form the embryo. The first embryonic cells generated\nhave the ability to differentiate into any type of cell in the body and, as such, are called totipotent, meaning each\nhas the capacity to divide, differentiate, and develop into a new organism.']","The three types of muscle tissue are skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle.","skeletal, cardiac, and smooth"

A phospholipid __.', 'Immediate treatment is with\npure oxygen. The affected person is then moved into a hyperbaric chamber. A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,\nclosed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body\nso that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to\nthe body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing\nsome of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.\nThe dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the\npressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body\ntissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the\npulsating flow of pressurized blood.\n1.5 Homeostasis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning\n•\nContrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism\nMaintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body\ntemperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point.\nA set point is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set\nof values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is\napproximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to\nfluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a).', 'The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+.

Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids.

Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–.\nBases\nA base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+ already present in\nsolution (see Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine\nwith H+ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+ and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases\nrelease most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H+. Food\nmixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract\nafter the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3–), a weak base that attracts H+. Bicarbonate\naccepts some of the H+ protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.\nThe Concept of pH\nThe relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution’s pH is the negative, base-10\nlogarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+\nconcentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times\nmore acidic than a solution with a pH of 5.

Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.', 'Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands. Connective tissue, as its name implies, binds the\ncells and organs of the body together and functions in the protection, support, and integration of all parts of the\nbody. Muscle tissue is excitable, responding to stimulation and contracting to provide movement, and occurs as\nthree major types: skeletal (voluntary) muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle in the heart. Nervous tissue is\nalso excitable, allowing the propagation of electrochemical signals in the form of nerve impulses that communicate\nbetween different regions of the body (Figure 4.2).\nThe next level of organization is the organ, where several types of tissues come together to form a working unit. Just\nas knowing the structure and function of cells helps you in your study of tissues, knowledge of tissues will help you\nunderstand how organs function.

The cytoskeleton is a group of fibrous proteins that provide structural support for cells, but this\nis only one of the functions of the cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal components are also critical for cell motility, cell\nreproduction, and transportation of substances within the cell.\nThe cytoskeleton forms a complex thread-like network throughout the cell consisting of three different kinds of\nprotein-based filaments: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules (Figure 3.18). The thickest of the\nthree is the microtubule, a structural filament composed of subunits of a protein called tubulin. Microtubules\nmaintain cell shape and structure, help resist compression of the cell, and play a role in positioning the organelles\nwithin the cell. Microtubules also make up two types of cellular appendages important for motion: cilia and flagella.\nCilia are found on many cells of the body, including the epithelial cells that line the airways of the respiratory\nsystem. Cilia move rhythmically; they beat constantly, moving waste materials such as dust, mucus, and bacteria\nupward through the airways, away from the lungs and toward the mouth.', 'Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body.

Which organ has primary control over the amount of water in the body?\nPositive Feedback\nPositive feedback intensifies a change in the body’s physiological condition rather than reversing it. A deviation\nfrom the normal range results in more change, and the system moves farther away from the normal range. Positive\nfeedback in the body is normal only when there is a definite end point. Childbirth and the body’s response to blood\nloss are two examples of positive feedback loops that are normal but are activated only when needed.\nChildbirth at full term is an example of a situation in which the maintenance of the existing body state is not desired.\nEnormous changes in a person’s body are required to expel the baby at the end of pregnancy. And the events of\nchildbirth, once begun, must progress rapidly to a conclusion or the life of a person giving bith and the baby are at\nrisk. The extreme muscular work of labor and delivery are the result of a positive feedback system (Figure 1.11).\nFIGURE 1.11\nPositive Feedback Loop\nNormal childbirth is driven by a positive feedback loop. A positive feedback loop results in a\nchange in the body’s status, rather than a return to homeostasis.\nThe first contractions of labor (the stimulus) push the baby toward the cervix (the lowest part of the uterus). The\ncervix contains stretch-sensitive nerve cells that monitor the degree of stretching (the sensors). These nerve cells\nsend messages to the brain, which in turn causes the pituitary gland at the base of the brain to release the hormone\noxytocin into the bloodstream.', 'The insulin signals skeletal muscle fibers, fat cells (adipocytes), and liver cells to take up the excess glucose,\nremoving it from the bloodstream. As glucose concentration in the bloodstream drops, the decrease in\nconcentration—the actual negative feedback—is detected by pancreatic alpha cells, and insulin release stops. This\nprevents blood sugar levels from continuing to drop below the normal range.\nHumans have a similar temperature regulation feedback system that works by promoting either heat loss or heat\ngain (Figure 1.10b). When the brain’s temperature regulation center receives data from the sensors indicating that\nthe body’s temperature exceeds its normal range, it stimulates a cluster of brain cells referred to as the “heat-loss\ncenter.” This stimulation has three major effects:\n•\nBlood vessels in the skin begin to dilate allowing more blood from the body core to flow to the surface of the\nskin allowing the heat to radiate into the environment.\n•\nAs blood flow to the skin increases, sweat glands are activated to increase their output.

This further increases heat loss from the lungs.\nIn contrast, activation of the brain’s heat-gain center by exposure to cold reduces blood flow to the skin, and blood\nreturning from the limbs is diverted into a network of deep veins. This arrangement traps heat closer to the body\ncore and restricts heat loss. If heat loss is severe, the brain triggers an increase in random signals to skeletal\nmuscles, causing them to contract and producing shivering. The muscle contractions of shivering release heat while\nusing up ATP. The brain triggers the thyroid gland in the endocrine system to release thyroid hormone, which\nincreases metabolic activity and heat production in cells throughout the body. The brain also signals the adrenal\nglands to release epinephrine (adrenaline), a hormone that causes the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which\ncan be used as an energy source. The breakdown of glycogen into glucose also results in increased metabolism and\nheat production.\n1.5 • Homeostasis\n21\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nWater concentration in the body is critical for proper functioning.', 'Another method of measuring the concentration of a solute is by its\nmolarity—which is moles (M) of the molecules per liter (L). The mole of an element is its atomic weight, while a mole\nof a compound is the sum of the atomic weights of its components, called the molecular weight. An often-used\nexample is calculating a mole of glucose, with the chemical formula C6H12O6. Using the periodic table, the atomic\nweight of carbon (C) is 12.011 grams (g), and there are six carbons in glucose, for a total atomic weight of 72.066 g.\nDoing the same calculations for hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O), the molecular weight equals 180.156g (the “gram\nmolecular weight” of glucose). When water is added to make one liter of solution, you have one mole (1M) of\nglucose. This is particularly useful in chemistry because of the relationship of moles to “Avogadro’s number.” A mole\nof any solution has the same number of particles in it: 6.02 × 1023. Many substances in the bloodstream and other\ntissue of the body are measured in thousandths of a mole, or millimoles (mM).\nA colloid is a mixture that is somewhat like a heavy solution. The solute particles consist of tiny clumps of molecules\nlarge enough to make the liquid mixture opaque (because the particles are large enough to scatter light). Familiar\nexamples of colloids are milk and cream. In the thyroid glands, the thyroid hormone is stored as a thick protein\nmixture also called a colloid.\nA suspension is a liquid mixture in which a heavier substance is suspended temporarily in a liquid, but over time,\nsettles out. This separation of particles from a suspension is called sedimentation. An example of sedimentation\noccurs in the blood test that establishes sedimentation rate, or sed rate. The test measures how quickly red blood\ncells in a test tube settle out of the watery portion of blood (known as plasma) over a set period of time. Rapid\nsedimentation of blood cells does not normally happen in the healthy body, but aspects of certain diseases can\ncause blood cells to clump together, and these heavy clumps of blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube\nmore quickly than do normal blood cells.', 'Watch this video (http://openstax.org/l/MRI)\nto learn more about MRIs. What is the function of magnets in an MRI?\nPositron Emission Tomography\nPositron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique involving the use of so-called\nradiopharmaceuticals, substances that emit radiation that is short-lived and therefore relatively safe to administer\nto the body. Although the first PET scanner was introduced in 1961, it took 15 more years before\nradiopharmaceuticals were combined with the technique and revolutionized its potential. The main advantage is\nthat PET (see Figure 1.19c) can illustrate physiologic activity—including nutrient metabolism and blood flow—of the\norgan or organs being targeted, whereas CT and MRI scans can only show static images. PET is widely used to\ndiagnose a multitude of conditions, such as heart disease, the spread of cancer, certain forms of infection, brain\nabnormalities, bone disease, and thyroid disease.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nPET relies on radioactive substances administered several minutes before the scan.

How is PET used in chemotherapy?\nUltrasonography\nUltrasonography is an imaging technique that uses the transmission of high-frequency sound waves into the body\nto generate an echo signal that is converted by a computer into a real-time image of anatomy and physiology (see\nFigure 1.19d). Ultrasonography is the least invasive of all imaging techniques, and it is therefore used more freely in\nsensitive situations such as pregnancy. The technology was first developed in the 1940s and 1950s.\nUltrasonography is used to study heart function, blood flow in the neck or extremities, certain conditions such as\ngallbladder disease, and fetal growth and development. The main disadvantages of ultrasonography are that the\nimage quality is heavily operator-dependent and that it is unable to penetrate bone and gas.\n1.', 'Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a). A sensor, also referred to a receptor, is a\ncomponent of a feedback system that monitors a physiological value. This value is reported to the control center.\nThe control center is the component in a feedback system that compares the value to the normal range. If the value\ndeviates too much from the set point, then the control center activates an effector. An effector is the component in\na feedback system that causes a change to reverse the situation and return the value to the normal range.\n20\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 1.10\nNegative Feedback System\nIn a negative feedback system, a stimulus—a deviation from a set point—is resisted through\na physiological process that returns the body to homeostasis.

Mucous, sweat, saliva, and\nbreast milk are all examples of secretions from exocrine glands. They are all discharged through tubular ducts.\nSecretions into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, technically outside of the body, are of the exocrine category.\nGlandular Structure\nExocrine glands are classified as either unicellular or multicellular. The unicellular glands are scattered single cells,\nsuch as goblet cells, found in the mucous membranes of the small and large intestine.\nThe multicellular exocrine glands known as serous glands develop from simple epithelium to form a secretory\nsurface that secretes directly into an inner cavity. These glands line the internal cavities of the abdomen and chest\nand release their secretions directly into the cavities. Other multicellular exocrine glands release their contents\nthrough a tubular duct. The duct is single in a simple gland but in compound glands is divided into one or more\nbranches (Figure 4.9). In tubular glands, the ducts can be straight or coiled, whereas tubes that form pockets are\nalveolar (acinar), such as the exocrine portion of the pancreas. Combinations of tubes and pockets are known as\ntubuloalveolar (tubuloacinar) compound glands. In a branched gland, a duct is connected to more than one\nsecretory group of cells.\n4.2 • Epithelial Tissue\n137\nFIGURE 4.9\nTypes of Exocrine Glands\nExocrine glands are classified by their structure.\nMethods and Types of Secretion\nExocrine glands can be classified by their mode of secretion and the nature of the substances released, as well as by\nthe structure of the glands and shape of ducts (Figure 4.10). Merocrine secretion is the most common type of\nexocrine secretion. The secretions are enclosed in vesicles that move to the apical surface of the cell where the\ncontents are released by exocytosis.

Most\nglands consist of groups of epithelial cells. A gland can be classified as an endocrine gland, a ductless gland that\nreleases secretions directly into surrounding tissues and fluids (endo- = “inside”), or an exocrine gland whose\nsecretions leave through a duct that opens directly, or indirectly, to the external environment (exo- = “outside”).\nEndocrine Glands\nThe secretions of endocrine glands are called hormones. Hormones are released into the interstitial fluid, diffused\ninto the bloodstream, and delivered to targets, in other words, cells that have receptors to bind the hormones. The\nendocrine system is part of a major regulatory system coordinating the regulation and integration of body\nresponses. A few examples of endocrine glands include the anterior pituitary, thymus, adrenal cortex, and gonads.\nExocrine Glands\nExocrine glands release their contents through a duct that leads to the epithelial surface. Mucous, sweat, saliva, and\nbreast milk are all examples of secretions from exocrine glands. They are all discharged through tubular ducts.\nSecretions into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, technically outside of the body, are of the exocrine category.', 'Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a). A sensor, also referred to a receptor, is a\ncomponent of a feedback system that monitors a physiological value. This value is reported to the control center.\nThe control center is the component in a feedback system that compares the value to the normal range. If the value\ndeviates too much from the set point, then the control center activates an effector. An effector is the component in\na feedback system that causes a change to reverse the situation and return the value to the normal range.\n20\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 1.10\nNegative Feedback System\nIn a negative feedback system, a stimulus—a deviation from a set point—is resisted through\na physiological process that returns the body to homeostasis. (a) A negative feedback system has five basic parts. (b) Body temperature is\nregulated by negative feedback.\nIn order to set the system in motion, a stimulus must drive a physiological parameter beyond its normal range (that\nis, beyond homeostasis). This stimulus is “heard” by a specific sensor. For example, in the control of blood glucose,\nspecific endocrine cells in the pancreas detect excess glucose (the stimulus) in the bloodstream. These pancreatic\nbeta cells respond to the increased level of blood glucose by releasing the hormone insulin into the bloodstream.\nThe insulin signals skeletal muscle fibers, fat cells (adipocytes), and liver cells to take up the excess glucose,\nremoving it from the bloodstream. As glucose concentration in the bloodstream drops, the decrease in\nconcentration—the actual negative feedback—is detected by pancreatic alpha cells, and insulin release stops. This\nprevents blood sugar levels from continuing to drop below the normal range.\nHumans have a similar temperature regulation feedback system that works by promoting either heat loss or heat\ngain (Figure 1.10b).']",The hormone released by the adrenal glands is epinephrine (adrenaline).,epinephrine (adrenaline)

The cells in the stratum basale bond to the\ndermis via intertwining collagen fibers, referred to as the basement membrane. A finger-like projection, or fold,\nknown as the dermal papilla (plural = dermal papillae) is found in the superficial portion of the dermis. Dermal\npapillae increase the strength of the connection between the epidermis and dermis; the greater the folding, the\nstronger the connections made (Figure 5.5).', 'In a growing fetus, fingerprints form where the cells of the stratum basale meet the papillae of the underlying\ndermal layer (papillary layer), resulting in the formation of the ridges on your fingers that you recognize as\nfingerprints. Fingerprints are unique to each individual and are used for forensic analyses because the patterns do\nnot change with the growth and aging processes.\nStratum Spinosum\nAs the name suggests, the stratum spinosum is spiny in appearance due to the protruding cell processes that join\nthe cells via a structure called a desmosome. The desmosomes interlock with each other and strengthen the bond\nbetween the cells. It is interesting to note that the “spiny” nature of this layer is an artifact of the staining process.\nUnstained epidermis samples do not exhibit this characteristic appearance. The stratum spinosum is composed of\neight to 10 layers of keratinocytes, formed as a result of cell division in the stratum basale (Figure 5.6).

Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia.

Salts are compounds\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\nsolution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H+,\nthereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).\nThe pH of any solution is its relative concentration of\nH+. A solution with pH 7 is neutral. Solutions with pH\nbelow 7 are acids, and solutions with pH above 7 are\nbases. A change in a single digit on the pH scale (e.g.,\nfrom 7 to 8) represents a ten-fold increase or decrease\nin the concentration of H+. In a healthy adult, the pH of\nblood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45.

A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,\nclosed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body\nso that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to\nthe body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing\nsome of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.\nThe dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the\npressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body\ntissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the\npulsating flow of pressurized blood.\n1.5 Homeostasis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning\n•\nContrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism\nMaintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body\ntemperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point.\nA set point is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set\nof values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is\napproximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to\nfluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a).', 'The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human\nurine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n59\nFIGURE 2.17\nThe pH Scale\nBuffers\nThe pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this\nslightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into\nthe bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids.', '35.

The dorsal cavity includes the cranial and spinal cavities.\n26\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nSubdivisions of the Posterior (Dorsal) and Anterior (Ventral) Cavities\nThe posterior (dorsal) and anterior (ventral) cavities are each subdivided into smaller cavities. In the posterior\n(dorsal) cavity, the cranial cavity houses the brain, and the spinal cavity (or vertebral cavity) encloses the spinal\ncord. Just as the brain and spinal cord make up a continuous, uninterrupted structure, the cranial and spinal cavities\nthat house them are also continuous. The brain and spinal cord are protected by the bones of the skull and vertebral\ncolumn and by cerebrospinal fluid, a colorless fluid produced by the brain, which cushions the brain and spinal cord\nwithin the posterior (dorsal) cavity.\nThe anterior (ventral) cavity has two main subdivisions: the thoracic cavity and the abdominopelvic cavity (see\nFigure 1.15). The thoracic cavity is the more superior subdivision of the anterior cavity, and it is enclosed by the rib\ncage. The thoracic cavity contains the lungs and the heart, which is located in the mediastinum. The diaphragm\nforms the floor of the thoracic cavity and separates it from the more inferior abdominopelvic cavity. The\nabdominopelvic cavity is the largest cavity in the body. Although no membrane physically divides the\nabdominopelvic cavity, it can be useful to distinguish between the abdominal cavity, the division that houses the\ndigestive organs, and the pelvic cavity, the division that houses the organs of reproduction.', 'The body responds to this potential catastrophe by releasing\nsubstances in the injured blood vessel wall that begin the process of blood clotting.

However, the\npurpose of this language is not to confuse, but rather to increase precision and reduce medical errors. For example,\nis a scar “above the wrist” located on the forearm two or three inches away from the hand? Or is it at the base of the\nhand? Is it on the palm-side or back-side? By using precise anatomical terminology, we eliminate ambiguity.\nAnatomical terms derive from ancient Greek and Latin words. Because these languages are no longer used in\neveryday conversation, the meaning of their words does not change.\nAnatomical terms are made up of roots, prefixes, and suffixes. The root of a term often refers to an organ, tissue, or\ncondition, whereas the prefix or suffix often describes the root. For example, in the disorder hypertension, the prefix\n“hyper-” means “high” or “over,” and the root word “tension” refers to pressure, so the word “hypertension” refers\nto abnormally high blood pressure.\nAnatomical Position\nTo further increase precision, anatomists standardize the way in which they view the body.', '29.

A standard reference position for\nmapping the body’s structures is the normal\nanatomical position. Regions of the body are identified\nusing terms such as “occipital” that are more precise\nthan common words and phrases such as “the back of\nthe head.” Directional terms such as anterior and\nposterior are essential for accurately describing the\nrelative locations of body structures.

Although no membrane physically divides the\nabdominopelvic cavity, it can be useful to distinguish between the abdominal cavity, the division that houses the\ndigestive organs, and the pelvic cavity, the division that houses the organs of reproduction.\nAbdominal Regions and Quadrants\nTo promote clear communication, for instance about the location of a patient’s abdominal pain or a suspicious mass,\nhealth care providers typically divide up the cavity into either nine regions or four quadrants (Figure 1.16).\nFIGURE 1.16\nRegions and Quadrants of the Peritoneal Cavity\nThere are (a) nine abdominal regions and (b) four abdominal\nquadrants in the peritoneal cavity.\nThe more detailed regional approach subdivides the cavity with one horizontal line immediately inferior to the ribs\nand one immediately superior to the pelvis, and two vertical lines drawn as if dropped from the midpoint of each\nclavicle (collarbone). There are nine resulting regions. The simpler quadrants approach, which is more commonly\nused in medicine, subdivides the cavity with one horizontal and one vertical line that intersect at the patient’s\numbilicus (navel).\nMembranes of the Anterior (Ventral) Body Cavity\nA serous membrane (also referred to a serosa) is one of the thin membranes that cover the walls and organs in the\nthoracic and abdominopelvic cavities. The parietal layers of the membranes line the walls of the body cavity (pariet-\nrefers to a cavity wall). The visceral layer of the membrane covers the organs (the viscera).

Muscle cells are excitable; they respond to a\nstimulus. They are contractile, meaning they can shorten and generate a pulling force. When attached between two\nmovable objects, in other words, bones, contractions of the muscles cause the bones to move. Some muscle\nmovement is voluntary, which means it is under conscious control. For example, a person decides to open a book\nand read a chapter on anatomy. Other movements are involuntary, meaning they are not under conscious control,\nsuch as the contraction of your pupil in bright light. Muscle tissue is classified into three types according to structure\nand function: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth (Table 4.2).', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.', 'Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands. Connective tissue, as its name implies, binds the\ncells and organs of the body together and functions in the protection, support, and integration of all parts of the\nbody.

What is the pH range of normal human blood?,"['These\ncompounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain\nboth hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and\ncushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a\nbyproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a\nreactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\nsolution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H+,\nthereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).\nThe pH of any solution is its relative concentration of\nH+. A solution with pH 7 is neutral. Solutions with pH\nbelow 7 are acids, and solutions with pH above 7 are\nbases. A change in a single digit on the pH scale (e.g.,\nfrom 7 to 8) represents a ten-fold increase or decrease\nin the concentration of H+. In a healthy adult, the pH of\nblood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45.

A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,\nclosed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body\nso that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to\nthe body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing\nsome of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.\nThe dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the\npressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body\ntissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the\npulsating flow of pressurized blood.\n1.5 Homeostasis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning\n•\nContrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism\nMaintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body\ntemperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point.\nA set point is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set\nof values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is\napproximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to\nfluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a).', 'The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human\nurine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n59\nFIGURE 2.17\nThe pH Scale\nBuffers\nThe pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this\nslightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into\nthe bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids.', '35.

Muscle cells are excitable; they respond to a\nstimulus. They are contractile, meaning they can shorten and generate a pulling force. When attached between two\nmovable objects, in other words, bones, contractions of the muscles cause the bones to move. Some muscle\nmovement is voluntary, which means it is under conscious control. For example, a person decides to open a book\nand read a chapter on anatomy. Other movements are involuntary, meaning they are not under conscious control,\nsuch as the contraction of your pupil in bright light. Muscle tissue is classified into three types according to structure\nand function: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth (Table 4.2).', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.', 'Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands. Connective tissue, as its name implies, binds the\ncells and organs of the body together and functions in the protection, support, and integration of all parts of the\nbody. Muscle tissue is excitable, responding to stimulation and contracting to provide movement, and occurs as\nthree major types: skeletal (voluntary) muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle in the heart. Nervous tissue is\nalso excitable, allowing the propagation of electrochemical signals in the form of nerve impulses that communicate\nbetween different regions of the body (Figure 4.2).\nThe next level of organization is the organ, where several types of tissues come together to form a working unit. Just\nas knowing the structure and function of cells helps you in your study of tissues, knowledge of tissues will help you\nunderstand how organs function. The epithelial and connective tissues are discussed in detail in this chapter. Muscle\nand nervous tissues will be discussed only briefly in this chapter.\n126\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 4.2\nFour Types of Tissue: Body\nThe four types of tissues are exemplified in nervous tissue, stratified squamous epithelial\ntissue, cardiac muscle tissue, and connective tissue.

What type of radiation does a CT scanner use?,"['(credit a: Akira Ohgaki/flickr; credit b: “Digital Cate”/flickr;\ncredit c: “Raziel”/Wikimedia Commons; credit d: “Isis”/Wikimedia Commons)\nSince 1970, the development of more powerful computers and more sophisticated software has made CT scanning\nroutine for many types of diagnostic evaluations. It is especially useful for soft tissue scanning, such as of the brain\nand the thoracic and abdominal viscera. Its level of detail is so precise that it can allow physicians to measure the\nsize of a mass down to a millimeter. The main disadvantage of CT scanning is that it exposes patients to a dose of\nradiation many times higher than that of X-rays. In fact, children who undergo CT scans are at increased risk of\ndeveloping cancer, as are adults who have multiple CT scans.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nA CT or CAT scan relies on a circling scanner that revolves around the patient’s body. Watch this video\n(http://openstax.org/l/CATscan) to learn more about CT and CAT scans. What type of radiation does a CT scanner\nuse?\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive medical imaging technique based on a phenomenon of nuclear\nphysics discovered in the 1930s, in which matter exposed to magnetic fields and radio waves was found to emit\nradio signals. In 1970, a physician and researcher named Raymond Damadian noticed that malignant (cancerous)\ntissue gave off different signals than normal body tissue. He applied for a patent for the first MRI scanning device,\nwhich was in use clinically by the early 1980s. The early MRI scanners were crude, but advances in digital\ncomputing and electronics led to their advancement over any other technique for precise imaging, especially to\ndiscover tumors. MRI also has the major advantage of not exposing patients to radiation.\nDrawbacks of MRI scans include their much higher cost, and patient discomfort with the procedure. The MRI\nscanner subjects the patient to such powerful electromagnets that the scan room must be shielded.', 'The body’s\norgans are organized in one of two main\ncavities—dorsal (also referred to posterior) and ventral\n(also referred to anterior)—which are further sub-\ndivided according to the structures present in each\narea. The serous membranes have two layers—parietal\nand visceral—surrounding a fluid filled space. Serous\nmembranes cover the lungs (pleural serosa), heart\n(pericardial serosa), and some abdominopelvic organs\n(peritoneal serosa).\n1.7 Medical Imaging\nDetailed anatomical drawings of the human body first\nbecame available in the fifteenth and sixteenth\ncenturies; however, it was not until the end of the\nnineteenth century, and the discovery of X-rays, that\nanatomists and physicians discovered non-surgical\nmethods to look inside a living body.

This mutual attraction gives the atom some structural stability. The\nattraction by the positively charged nucleus helps keep electrons from straying far. The number of protons and\nelectrons within a neutral atom are equal, thus, the atom’s overall charge is balanced.\nAtomic Number and Mass Number\nAn atom of carbon is unique to carbon, but a proton of carbon is not. One proton is the same as another, whether it is\nfound in an atom of carbon, sodium (Na), or iron (Fe). The same is true for neutrons and electrons.

Moreover, all atoms of carbon, whether found in your liver or in a lump\nof coal, contain six protons.']",The smallest quantity of an element that retains the unique properties of that element is an atom.,an atom
What is the number of electrons in an atom's valence shell that makes it stable?,"['The factor that most strongly governs the tendency of an atom to participate in chemical reactions is the number of\nelectrons in its valence shell. A valence shell is an atom’s outermost electron shell. If the valence shell is full, the\natom is stable; meaning its electrons are unlikely to be pulled away from the nucleus by the electrical charge of\nother atoms. If the valence shell is not full, the atom is reactive; meaning it will tend to react with other atoms in\nways that make the valence shell full. Consider hydrogen, with its one electron only half-filling its valence shell. This\nsingle electron is likely to be drawn into relationships with the atoms of other elements, so that hydrogen’s single\nvalence shell can be stabilized.\nAll atoms (except hydrogen and helium with their single electron shells) are most stable when there are exactly\neight electrons in their valence shell. This principle is referred to as the octet rule, and it states that an atom will give\nup, gain, or share electrons with another atom so that it ends up with eight electrons in its own valence shell. For\nexample, oxygen, with six electrons in its valence shell, is likely to react with other atoms in a way that results in the\naddition of two electrons to oxygen’s valence shell, bringing the number to eight. When two hydrogen atoms each\nshare their single electron with oxygen, covalent bonds are formed, resulting in a molecule of water, H2O.\nIn nature, atoms of one element tend to join with atoms of other elements in characteristic ways. For example,\ncarbon commonly fills its valence shell by linking up with four atoms of hydrogen. In so doing, the two elements\nform the simplest of organic molecules, methane, which also is one of the most abundant and stable carbon-\ncontaining compounds on Earth. As stated above, another example is water; oxygen needs two electrons to fill its\nvalence shell. It commonly interacts with two atoms of hydrogen, forming H2O. Incidentally, the name “hydrogen”\nreflects its contribution to water (hydro- = “water”; -gen = “maker”).', 'A bond is a weak or strong electrical attraction that holds atoms in\nthe same vicinity. The new grouping is typically more stable—less likely to react again—than its component atoms\nwere when they were separate. A more or less stable grouping of two or more atoms held together by chemical\nbonds is called a molecule. The bonded atoms may be of the same element, as in the case of H2, which is called\nmolecular hydrogen or hydrogen gas. When a molecule is made up of two or more atoms of different elements, it is\ncalled a chemical compound. Thus, a unit of water, or H2O, is a compound, as is a single molecule of the gas\nmethane, or CH4.\nThree types of chemical bonds are important in human physiology, because they hold together substances that are\nused by the body for critical aspects of homeostasis, signaling, and energy production, to name just a few important\nprocesses. These are ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds.\nIons and Ionic Bonds\nRecall that an atom typically has the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons.\nAs long as this situation remains, the atom is electrically neutral. But when an atom participates in a chemical\nreaction that results in the donation or acceptance of one or more electrons, the atom will then become positively or\nnegatively charged. This happens frequently for most atoms in order to have a full valence shell, as described\npreviously. This can happen either by gaining electrons to fill a shell that is more than half-full, or by giving away\nelectrons to empty a shell that is less than half-full, thereby leaving the next smaller electron shell as the new, full,\nvalence shell. An atom that has an electrical charge—whether positive or negative—is an ion.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nVisit this website (http://openstax.org/l/electenergy) to learn about electrical energy and the attraction/repulsion of\ncharges.

Its atomic number is 19. It has just one\nelectron in its valence shell. This characteristic makes potassium highly likely to participate in chemical reactions in\nwhich it donates one electron.', 'The precise number of shells depends on the number of electrons in the atom. Hydrogen and helium\nhave just one and two electrons, respectively. If you take a look at the periodic table of the elements, you will notice\nthat hydrogen and helium are placed alone on either sides of the top row; they are the only elements that have just\none electron shell (Figure 2.7). A second shell is necessary to hold the electrons in all elements larger than hydrogen\nand helium.\nLithium (Li), whose atomic number is 3, has three electrons. Two of these fill the first electron shell, and the third\nspills over into a second shell. The second electron shell can accommodate as many as eight electrons. Carbon, with\nits six electrons, entirely fills its first shell, and half-fills its second. With ten electrons, neon (Ne) entirely fills its two\nelectron shells. Again, a look at the periodic table reveals that all of the elements in the second row, from lithium to\nneon, have just two electron shells. Atoms with more than ten electrons require more than two shells. These\nelements occupy the third and subsequent rows of the periodic table.\n2.1 • Elements and Atoms: The Building Blocks of Matter\n45\nFIGURE 2.7\nElectron Shells\nElectrons orbit the atomic nucleus at distinct levels of energy called electron shells. (a) With one electron,\nhydrogen only half-fills its electron shell. Helium also has a single shell, but its two electrons completely fill it. (b) The electrons of carbon\ncompletely fill its first electron shell, but only half-fills its second. (c) Neon, an element that does not occur in the body, has 10 electrons,\nfilling both of its electron shells.\nThe factor that most strongly governs the tendency of an atom to participate in chemical reactions is the number of\nelectrons in its valence shell.

(It is easier for potassium to donate one electron than to gain seven electrons.) The\nloss will cause the positive charge of potassium’s protons to be more influential than the negative charge of\npotassium’s electrons. In other words, the resulting potassium ion will be slightly positive. A potassium ion is\nwritten K+, indicating that it has lost a single electron. A positively charged ion is known as a cation.\nNow consider fluorine (F), a component of bones and teeth. Its atomic number is nine, and it has seven electrons in\nits valence shell. Thus, it is highly likely to bond with other atoms in such a way that fluorine accepts one electron (it\nis easier for fluorine to gain one electron than to donate seven electrons). When it does, its electrons will outnumber\nits protons by one, and it will have an overall negative charge. The ionized form of fluorine is called fluoride, and is\nwritten as F–.

If the valence shell is full, the\natom is stable; meaning its electrons are unlikely to be pulled away from the nucleus by the electrical charge of\nother atoms. If the valence shell is not full, the atom is reactive; meaning it will tend to react with other atoms in\nways that make the valence shell full. Consider hydrogen, with its one electron only half-filling its valence shell. This\nsingle electron is likely to be drawn into relationships with the atoms of other elements, so that hydrogen’s single\nvalence shell can be stabilized.\nAll atoms (except hydrogen and helium with their single electron shells) are most stable when there are exactly\neight electrons in their valence shell. This principle is referred to as the octet rule, and it states that an atom will give\nup, gain, or share electrons with another atom so that it ends up with eight electrons in its own valence shell. For\nexample, oxygen, with six electrons in its valence shell, is likely to react with other atoms in a way that results in the\naddition of two electrons to oxygen’s valence shell, bringing the number to eight. When two hydrogen atoms each\nshare their single electron with oxygen, covalent bonds are formed, resulting in a molecule of water, H2O.\nIn nature, atoms of one element tend to join with atoms of other elements in characteristic ways. For example,\ncarbon commonly fills its valence shell by linking up with four atoms of hydrogen. In so doing, the two elements\nform the simplest of organic molecules, methane, which also is one of the most abundant and stable carbon-\ncontaining compounds on Earth. As stated above, another example is water; oxygen needs two electrons to fill its\nvalence shell. It commonly interacts with two atoms of hydrogen, forming H2O. Incidentally, the name “hydrogen”\nreflects its contribution to water (hydro- = “water”; -gen = “maker”).', 'Protons and\nneutrons contribute nearly all of an atom’s mass; the\nnumber of protons and neutrons is an element’s mass\nnumber. Heavier and lighter versions of the same\nelement can occur in nature because these versions\nhave different numbers of neutrons. Different versions\nof an element are called isotopes.\nThe tendency of an atom to be stable or to react readily\nwith other atoms is largely due to the behavior of the\nelectrons within the atom’s outermost electron shell,\ncalled its valence shell. Helium, as well as larger atoms\nwith eight electrons in their valence shell, is unlikely to\nparticipate in chemical reactions because they are\nstable. All other atoms tend to accept, donate, or share\nelectrons in a process that brings the electrons in their\nvalence shell to eight (or in the case of hydrogen, to\ntwo).\n2.2 Chemical Bonds\nEach moment of life, atoms of oxygen, carbon,\nhydrogen, and the other elements of the human body\nare making and breaking chemical bonds. Ions are\ncharged atoms that form when an atom donates or\naccepts one or more negatively charged electrons.\nCations (ions with a positive charge) are attracted to\nanions (ions with a negative charge). This attraction is\ncalled an ionic bond. In covalent bonds, the\nparticipating atoms do not lose or gain electrons, but\nrather share them. Molecules with nonpolar covalent\nbonds are electrically balanced, and have a linear\n76\n2 • Chapter Review\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nthree-dimensional shape. Molecules with polar\ncovalent bonds have “poles”—regions of weakly\npositive and negative charge—and have a triangular\nthree-dimensional shape. An atom of oxygen and two\natoms of hydrogen form water molecules by means of\npolar covalent bonds. Hydrogen bonds link hydrogen\natoms already participating in polar covalent bonds to\nanions or electronegative regions of other polar\nmolecules. Hydrogen bonds link water molecules,\nresulting in the properties of water that are important\nto living things.\n2.3 Chemical Reactions\nChemical reactions, in which chemical bonds are\nbroken and formed, require an initial investment of\nenergy.', 'The precise number of shells depends on the number of electrons in the atom. Hydrogen and helium\nhave just one and two electrons, respectively. If you take a look at the periodic table of the elements, you will notice\nthat hydrogen and helium are placed alone on either sides of the top row; they are the only elements that have just\none electron shell (Figure 2.7). A second shell is necessary to hold the electrons in all elements larger than hydrogen\nand helium.\nLithium (Li), whose atomic number is 3, has three electrons. Two of these fill the first electron shell, and the third\nspills over into a second shell. The second electron shell can accommodate as many as eight electrons. Carbon, with\nits six electrons, entirely fills its first shell, and half-fills its second. With ten electrons, neon (Ne) entirely fills its two\nelectron shells. Again, a look at the periodic table reveals that all of the elements in the second row, from lithium to\nneon, have just two electron shells. Atoms with more than ten electrons require more than two shells. These\nelements occupy the third and subsequent rows of the periodic table.\n2.1 • Elements and Atoms: The Building Blocks of Matter\n45\nFIGURE 2.7\nElectron Shells\nElectrons orbit the atomic nucleus at distinct levels of energy called electron shells. (a) With one electron,\nhydrogen only half-fills its electron shell. Helium also has a single shell, but its two electrons completely fill it. (b) The electrons of carbon\ncompletely fill its first electron shell, but only half-fills its second. (c) Neon, an element that does not occur in the body, has 10 electrons,\nfilling both of its electron shells.\nThe factor that most strongly governs the tendency of an atom to participate in chemical reactions is the number of\nelectrons in its valence shell. A valence shell is an atom’s outermost electron shell. If the valence shell is full, the\natom is stable; meaning its electrons are unlikely to be pulled away from the nucleus by the electrical charge of\nother atoms. If the valence shell is not full, the atom is reactive; meaning it will tend to react with other atoms in\nways that make the valence shell full.', 'A bond is a weak or strong electrical attraction that holds atoms in\nthe same vicinity. The new grouping is typically more stable—less likely to react again—than its component atoms\nwere when they were separate. A more or less stable grouping of two or more atoms held together by chemical\nbonds is called a molecule. The bonded atoms may be of the same element, as in the case of H2, which is called\nmolecular hydrogen or hydrogen gas. When a molecule is made up of two or more atoms of different elements, it is\ncalled a chemical compound. Thus, a unit of water, or H2O, is a compound, as is a single molecule of the gas\nmethane, or CH4.\nThree types of chemical bonds are important in human physiology, because they hold together substances that are\nused by the body for critical aspects of homeostasis, signaling, and energy production, to name just a few important\nprocesses. These are ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds.\nIons and Ionic Bonds\nRecall that an atom typically has the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons.\nAs long as this situation remains, the atom is electrically neutral. But when an atom participates in a chemical\nreaction that results in the donation or acceptance of one or more electrons, the atom will then become positively or\nnegatively charged. This happens frequently for most atoms in order to have a full valence shell, as described\npreviously. This can happen either by gaining electrons to fill a shell that is more than half-full, or by giving away\nelectrons to empty a shell that is less than half-full, thereby leaving the next smaller electron shell as the new, full,\nvalence shell. An atom that has an electrical charge—whether positive or negative—is an ion.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nVisit this website (http://openstax.org/l/electenergy) to learn about electrical energy and the attraction/repulsion of\ncharges. What happens to the charged electroscope when a conductor is moved between its plastic sheets, and\nwhy?\nPotassium (K), for instance, is an important element in all body cells. Its atomic number is 19. It has just one\nelectron in its valence shell. This characteristic makes potassium highly likely to participate in chemical reactions in\nwhich it donates one electron.', 'The four types most important to human structure and function are carbohydrates,\nlipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Before exploring these compounds, you need to first understand the chemistry of\ncarbon.\nThe Chemistry of Carbon\nWhat makes organic compounds ubiquitous is the chemistry of their carbon core. Recall that carbon atoms have four\nelectrons in their valence shell, and that the octet rule dictates that atoms tend to react in such a way as to\ncomplete their valence shell with eight electrons. Carbon atoms do not complete their valence shells by donating or\naccepting four electrons. Instead, they readily share electrons via covalent bonds.\nCommonly, carbon atoms share with other carbon atoms, often forming a long carbon chain referred to as a carbon\nskeleton. When they do share, however, they do not share all their electrons exclusively with each other. Rather,\ncarbon atoms tend to share electrons with a variety of other elements, one of which is always hydrogen. Carbon and\nhydrogen groupings are called hydrocarbons. If you study the figures of organic compounds in the remainder of this\nchapter, you will see several with chains of hydrocarbons in one region of the compound.\nMany combinations are possible to fill carbon’s four “vacancies.” Carbon may share electrons with oxygen or\nnitrogen or other atoms in a particular region of an organic compound. Moreover, the atoms to which carbon atoms\nbond may also be part of a functional group. A functional group is a group of atoms linked by strong covalent bonds\n2.5 • Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n61\nand tending to function in chemical reactions as a single unit. You can think of functional groups as tightly knit\n“cliques” whose members are unlikely to be parted.

Muscle cells are excitable; they respond to a\nstimulus. They are contractile, meaning they can shorten and generate a pulling force. When attached between two\nmovable objects, in other words, bones, contractions of the muscles cause the bones to move. Some muscle\nmovement is voluntary, which means it is under conscious control. For example, a person decides to open a book\nand read a chapter on anatomy. Other movements are involuntary, meaning they are not under conscious control,\nsuch as the contraction of your pupil in bright light. Muscle tissue is classified into three types according to structure\nand function: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth (Table 4.2).', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.', 'Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands. Connective tissue, as its name implies, binds the\ncells and organs of the body together and functions in the protection, support, and integration of all parts of the\nbody. Muscle tissue is excitable, responding to stimulation and contracting to provide movement, and occurs as\nthree major types: skeletal (voluntary) muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle in the heart. Nervous tissue is\nalso excitable, allowing the propagation of electrochemical signals in the form of nerve impulses that communicate\nbetween different regions of the body (Figure 4.2).\nThe next level of organization is the organ, where several types of tissues come together to form a working unit. Just\nas knowing the structure and function of cells helps you in your study of tissues, knowledge of tissues will help you\nunderstand how organs function. The epithelial and connective tissues are discussed in detail in this chapter. Muscle\nand nervous tissues will be discussed only briefly in this chapter.\n126\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 4.2\nFour Types of Tissue: Body\nThe four types of tissues are exemplified in nervous tissue, stratified squamous epithelial\ntissue, cardiac muscle tissue, and connective tissue.

What is the pH range of normal human blood?,"['These\ncompounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain\nboth hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and\ncushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a\nbyproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a\nreactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\nsolution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H+,\nthereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).\nThe pH of any solution is its relative concentration of\nH+. A solution with pH 7 is neutral. Solutions with pH\nbelow 7 are acids, and solutions with pH above 7 are\nbases. A change in a single digit on the pH scale (e.g.,\nfrom 7 to 8) represents a ten-fold increase or decrease\nin the concentration of H+. In a healthy adult, the pH of\nblood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45.

A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,\nclosed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body\nso that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to\nthe body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing\nsome of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.\nThe dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the\npressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body\ntissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the\npulsating flow of pressurized blood.\n1.5 Homeostasis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning\n•\nContrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism\nMaintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body\ntemperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point.\nA set point is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set\nof values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is\napproximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to\nfluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a).', 'The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human\nurine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n59\nFIGURE 2.17\nThe pH Scale\nBuffers\nThe pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this\nslightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into\nthe bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids.', '35.

As with\nacidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low.\nLung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the\nnormal concentration of H+.\nMetabolic alkalosis often results from prolonged, severe vomiting, which causes a loss of hydrogen and chloride ions\n(as components of HCl).

Recall that carbon atoms have four\nelectrons in their valence shell, and that the octet rule dictates that atoms tend to react in such a way as to\ncomplete their valence shell with eight electrons.', 'Cell to Cell Junctions\nCells of epithelia are closely connected and are not separated by intracellular material. Three basic types of\nconnections allow varying degrees of interaction between the cells: tight junctions, anchoring junctions, and gap\njunctions (Figure 4.5).\n4.2 • Epithelial Tissue\n131\nFIGURE 4.5\nTypes of Cell Junctions\nThe three basic types of cell-to-cell junctions are tight junctions, gap junctions, and anchoring\njunctions.\nAt one end of the spectrum is the tight junction, which separates the cells into apical and basal compartments.\nWhen two adjacent epithelial cells form a tight junction, there is no extracellular space between them and the\nmovement of substances through the extracellular space between the cells is blocked. This enables the epithelia to\nact as selective barriers. An anchoring junction includes several types of cell junctions that help stabilize epithelial\ntissues. Anchoring junctions are common on the lateral and basal surfaces of cells where they provide strong and\nflexible connections. There are three types of anchoring junctions: desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, and adherens.\nDesmosomes occur in patches on the membranes of cells. The patches are structural proteins on the inner surface\nof the cell’s membrane. The adhesion molecule, cadherin, is embedded in these patches and projects through the\ncell membrane to link with the cadherin molecules of adjacent cells. These connections are especially important in\nholding cells together. Hemidesmosomes, which look like half a desmosome, link cells to the extracellular matrix,\nfor example, the basal lamina. While similar in appearance to desmosomes, they include the adhesion proteins\ncalled integrins rather than cadherins. Adherens junctions use either cadherins or integrins depending on whether\nthey are linking to other cells or matrix. The junctions are characterized by the presence of the contractile protein\nactin located on the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. The actin can connect isolated patches or form a\nbelt-like structure inside the cell. These junctions influence the shape and folding of the epithelial tissue.', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts.

Some epithelia\n130\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\noften include structural features that allow the selective transport of molecules and ions across their cell\nmembranes.\nMany epithelial cells are capable of secretion and release mucous and specific chemical compounds onto their\napical surfaces. The epithelium of the small intestine releases digestive enzymes, for example. Cells lining the\nrespiratory tract secrete mucous that traps incoming microorganisms and particles. A glandular epithelium contains\nmany secretory cells.\nThe Epithelial Cell\nEpithelial cells are typically characterized by the polarized distribution of organelles and membrane-bound proteins\nbetween their basal and apical surfaces. Particular structures found in some epithelial cells are an adaptation to\nspecific functions. Certain organelles are segregated to the basal sides, whereas other organelles and extensions,\nsuch as cilia, when present, are on the apical surface.\nCilia are microscopic extensions of the apical cell membrane that are supported by microtubules. They beat in\nunison and move fluids as well as trapped particles. Ciliated epithelium lines the ventricles of the brain where it\nhelps circulate the cerebrospinal fluid. The ciliated epithelium of your airway forms a mucociliary escalator that\nsweeps particles of dust and pathogens trapped in the secreted mucous toward the throat. It is called an escalator\nbecause it continuously pushes mucous with trapped particles upward. In contrast, nasal cilia sweep the mucous\nblanket down towards your throat. In both cases, the transported materials are usually swallowed, and end up in the\nacidic environment of your stomach.\nCell to Cell Junctions\nCells of epithelia are closely connected and are not separated by intracellular material.

What is the activation energy of a chemical reaction without an enzyme?,"['Enzymes and Other Catalysts\nFor two chemicals in nature to react with each other they first have to come into contact, and this occurs through\nrandom collisions. Because heat helps increase the kinetic energy of atoms, ions, and molecules, it promotes their\ncollision. But in the body, extremely high heat—such as a very high fever—can damage body cells and be life-\nthreatening. On the other hand, normal body temperature is not high enough to promote the chemical reactions that\nsustain life. That is where catalysts come in.\nIn chemistry, a catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any\nchange. You can think of a catalyst as a chemical change agent. They help increase the rate and force at which\natoms, ions, and molecules collide, thereby increasing the probability that their valence shell electrons will interact.\nThe most important catalysts in the human body are enzymes. An enzyme is a catalyst composed of protein or\nribonucleic acid (RNA), both of which will be discussed later in this chapter. Like all catalysts, enzymes work by\nlowering the level of energy that needs to be invested in a chemical reaction. A chemical reaction’s activation\nenergy is the “threshold” level of energy needed to break the bonds in the reactants. Once those bonds are broken,\nnew arrangements can form. Without an enzyme to act as a catalyst, a much larger investment of energy is needed\nto ignite a chemical reaction (Figure 2.13).\nFIGURE 2.13\nEnzymes\nEnzymes decrease the activation energy required for a given chemical reaction to occur. (a) Without an enzyme,\nthe energy input needed for a reaction to begin is high. (b) With the help of an enzyme, less energy is needed for a reaction to begin.\nEnzymes are critical to the body’s healthy functioning. They assist, for example, with the breakdown of food and its\nconversion to energy. In fact, most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by enzymes.', 'For example, when glucose first\nenters a cell, a phosphate group is transferred from ATP, forming glucose phosphate (C6H12O6—P) and ADP.

This section of the chapter narrows the focus to the chemistry of human life; that is, the\ncompounds important for the body’s structure and function. In general, these compounds are either inorganic or\norganic.\n•\nAn inorganic compound is a substance that does not contain both carbon and hydrogen. A great many\ninorganic compounds do contain hydrogen atoms, such as water (H2O) and the hydrochloric acid (HCl)\nproduced by your stomach. In contrast, only a handful of inorganic compounds contain carbon atoms. Carbon\ndioxide (CO2) is one of the few examples.\n•\nAn organic compound, then, is a substance that contains both carbon and hydrogen. Organic compounds are\nsynthesized via covalent bonds within living organisms, including the human body. Recall that carbon and\nhydrogen are the second and third most abundant elements in your body. You will soon discover how these two\nelements combine in the foods you eat, in the compounds that make up your body structure, and in the\nchemicals that fuel your functioning.', 'In contrast, RNA consists of a single strand of sugar-phosphate backbone studded with bases. Messenger RNA\n(mRNA) is created during protein synthesis to carry the genetic instructions from the DNA to the cell’s protein\nmanufacturing plants in the cytoplasm, the ribosomes.\nAdenosine Triphosphate\nThe nucleotide adenosine triphosphate (ATP), is composed of a ribose sugar, an adenine base, and three phosphate\ngroups (Figure 2.30). ATP is classified as a high energy compound because the two covalent bonds linking its three\nphosphates store a significant amount of potential energy. In the body, the energy released from these high energy\nbonds helps fuel the body’s activities, from muscle contraction to the transport of substances in and out of cells to\nanabolic chemical reactions.\n2.5 • Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n73\nFIGURE 2.30\nStructure of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)\nWhen a phosphate group is cleaved from ATP, the products are adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic\nphosphate (Pi). This hydrolysis reaction can be written:\nRemoval of a second phosphate leaves adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and two phosphate groups. Again, these\nreactions also liberate the energy that had been stored in the phosphate-phosphate bonds. They are reversible, too,\nas when ADP undergoes phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is the addition of a phosphate group to an organic\ncompound, in this case, resulting in ATP. In such cases, the same level of energy that had been released during\nhydrolysis must be reinvested to power dehydration synthesis.\nCells can also transfer a phosphate group from ATP to another organic compound. For example, when glucose first\nenters a cell, a phosphate group is transferred from ATP, forming glucose phosphate (C6H12O6—P) and ADP. Once\nglucose is phosphorylated in this way, it can be stored as glycogen or metabolized for immediate energy.\n74\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nKey Terms\nacid\ncompound that releases hydrogen ions (H+) in\nsolution\nactivation energy\namount of energy greater than the\nenergy contained in the reactants,', 'Just as you can express mathematical calculations in equations such as 2 + 7 = 9, you can use chemical equations\nto show how reactants become products.

Correspondingly, the breakdown of ammonia into its components would be written\nas\nNotice that, in the first example, a nitrogen (N) atom and three hydrogen (H) atoms bond to form a compound. This\nanabolic reaction requires energy, which is then stored within the compound’s bonds. Such reactions are referred to\nas synthesis reactions. A synthesis reaction is a chemical reaction that results in the synthesis (joining) of\ncomponents that were formerly separate (Figure 2.12a). Again, nitrogen and hydrogen are reactants in a synthesis\nreaction that yields ammonia as the product.

Such reactions are referred to as decomposition reactions. A decomposition\nreaction is a chemical reaction that breaks down or “de-composes” something larger into its constituent parts (see\nFigure 2.12b). The general equation for a decomposition reaction is:\n.\nAn exchange reaction is a chemical reaction in which both synthesis and decomposition occur, chemical bonds are\nboth formed and broken, and chemical energy is absorbed, stored, and released (see Figure 2.12c). The simplest\nform of an exchange reaction might be:\n. Notice that, to produce these products, B and C had to\nbreak apart in a decomposition reaction, whereas A and B had to bond in a synthesis reaction. A more complex\nexchange reaction might be:\n. Another example might be:\n.\nIn theory, any chemical reaction can proceed in either direction under the right conditions.']","The activation energy of a chemical reaction without an enzyme is high, requiring a significant investment of energy to break the bonds in the reactants before the reaction can proceed.",a much larger investment of energy
What are the three types of monosaccharides?,"['These can build up in the blood, causing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Kidney failure,\nliver failure, heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.\nIn contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic). As with\nacidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low.\nLung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the\nnormal concentration of H+.\nMetabolic alkalosis often results from prolonged, severe vomiting, which causes a loss of hydrogen and chloride ions\n(as components of HCl). Medications also can prompt alkalosis. These include diuretics that cause the body to lose\npotassium ions, as well as antacids when taken in excessive amounts, for instance by someone with persistent\nheartburn or an ulcer.\n2.5 Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nIdentify four types of organic molecules essential to human functioning\n•\nExplain the chemistry behind carbon’s affinity for covalently bonding in organic compounds\n•\nProvide examples of three types of carbohydrates, and identify the primary functions of carbohydrates in the\nbody\n•\nDiscuss four types of lipids important in human functioning\n•\nDescribe the structure of proteins, and discuss their importance to human functioning\n•\nIdentify the building blocks of nucleic acids, and the roles of DNA, RNA, and ATP in human functioning\nOrganic compounds typically consist of groups of carbon atoms covalently bonded to hydrogen, usually oxygen, and\noften other elements as well.

Muscle cells are excitable; they respond to a\nstimulus. They are contractile, meaning they can shorten and generate a pulling force. When attached between two\nmovable objects, in other words, bones, contractions of the muscles cause the bones to move. Some muscle\nmovement is voluntary, which means it is under conscious control. For example, a person decides to open a book\nand read a chapter on anatomy. Other movements are involuntary, meaning they are not under conscious control,\nsuch as the contraction of your pupil in bright light. Muscle tissue is classified into three types according to structure\nand function: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth (Table 4.2).', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.', 'Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands. Connective tissue, as its name implies, binds the\ncells and organs of the body together and functions in the protection, support, and integration of all parts of the\nbody. Muscle tissue is excitable, responding to stimulation and contracting to provide movement, and occurs as\nthree major types: skeletal (voluntary) muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle in the heart. Nervous tissue is\nalso excitable, allowing the propagation of electrochemical signals in the form of nerve impulses that communicate\nbetween different regions of the body (Figure 4.2).\nThe next level of organization is the organ, where several types of tissues come together to form a working unit. Just\nas knowing the structure and function of cells helps you in your study of tissues, knowledge of tissues will help you\nunderstand how organs function. The epithelial and connective tissues are discussed in detail in this chapter. Muscle\nand nervous tissues will be discussed only briefly in this chapter.\n126\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 4.2\nFour Types of Tissue: Body\nThe four types of tissues are exemplified in nervous tissue, stratified squamous epithelial\ntissue, cardiac muscle tissue, and connective tissue.

After fertilization the zygote\ngives rise to rapid mitotic cycles, generating many cells to form the embryo. The first embryonic cells generated\nhave the ability to differentiate into any type of cell in the body and, as such, are called totipotent, meaning each\nhas the capacity to divide, differentiate, and develop into a new organism.']","The three types of muscle tissue are skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle.","skeletal, cardiac, and smooth"
What are the nine essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized by the body?,"['Sulfur\ndoes not readily participate in hydrogen bonds, whereas all other amino acids do. This variation influences the way\nthat proteins containing cysteine and methionine are assembled.\nAmino acids join via dehydration synthesis to form protein polymers (Figure 2.25). The unique bond holding amino\nacids together is called a peptide bond. A peptide bond is a covalent bond between two amino acids that forms by\ndehydration synthesis. A peptide, in fact, is a very short chain of amino acids. Strands containing fewer than about\n100 amino acids are generally referred to as polypeptides rather than proteins.\nFIGURE 2.25\nPeptide Bond\nDifferent amino acids join together to form peptides, polypeptides, or proteins via dehydration synthesis.\nThe bonds between the amino acids are peptide bonds R1 and R2 may be the same or different side chains.\nThe body is able to synthesize most of the amino acids from components of other molecules; however, nine cannot\nbe synthesized and have to be consumed in the diet. These are known as the essential amino acids.\nFree amino acids available for protein construction are said to reside in the amino acid pool within cells. Structures\nwithin cells use these amino acids when assembling proteins. If a particular essential amino acid is not available in\nsufficient quantities in the amino acid pool, however, synthesis of proteins containing it can slow or even cease.\nShape of Proteins\nJust as a fork cannot be used to eat soup and a spoon cannot be used to spear meat, a protein’s shape is essential\nto its function. A protein’s shape is determined, most fundamentally, by the sequence of amino acids of which it is\nmade (Figure 2.26a). The sequence is called the primary structure of the protein.\n2.5 • Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n69\nFIGURE 2.26\nThe Shape of Proteins\n(a) The primary structure is the sequence of amino acids that make up the polypeptide chain. (b)\nThe secondary structure, which can take the form of an alpha-helix or a beta-pleated sheet, is maintained by hydrogen bonds between\namino acids in different regions of the original polypeptide strand. (c) The tertiary structure occurs as a result of further folding and bonding\nof the secondary structure.', 'While carbohydrates and lipids are composed of hydrocarbons and oxygen, all\nproteins also contain nitrogen (N), and many contain sulfur (S), in addition to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.\nMicrostructure of Proteins\nProteins are polymers made up of nitrogen-containing monomers called amino acids. An amino acid is a molecule\ncomposed of an amino group and a carboxyl group, together with a variable side chain. Just 20 different amino acids\ncontribute to nearly all of the thousands of different proteins important in human structure and function. Body\nproteins contain a unique combination of a few dozen to a few hundred of these 20 amino acid monomers. All 20 of\nthese amino acids share a similar structure (Figure 2.24). All consist of a central carbon atom to which the following\nare bonded:\n•\na hydrogen atom\n•\nan alkaline (basic) amino group NH2 (see Table 2.1)\n•\nan acidic carboxyl group COOH (see Table 2.1)\n•\na variable group\nFIGURE 2.24\nStructure of an Amino Acid\n68\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNotice that all amino acids contain both an acid (the carboxyl group) and a base (the amino group) (amine =\n“nitrogen-containing”). For this reason, they make excellent buffers, helping the body regulate acid–base balance.\nWhat distinguishes the 20 amino acids from one another is their variable group, which is referred to as a side chain\nor an R-group. This group can vary in size and can be polar or nonpolar, giving each amino acid its unique\ncharacteristics. For example, the side chains of two amino acids—cysteine and methionine—contain sulfur. Sulfur\ndoes not readily participate in hydrogen bonds, whereas all other amino acids do. This variation influences the way\nthat proteins containing cysteine and methionine are assembled.\nAmino acids join via dehydration synthesis to form protein polymers (Figure 2.25).

(c) The tertiary structure occurs as a result of further folding and bonding\nof the secondary structure. (d) The quaternary structure occurs as a result of interactions between two or more tertiary subunits. The\nexample shown here is hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells which transports oxygen to body tissues.\nAlthough some polypeptides exist as linear chains, most are twisted or folded into more complex secondary\nstructures that form when bonding occurs between amino acids with different properties at different regions of the\npolypeptide. The most common secondary structure is a spiral called an alpha-helix. If you were to take a length of\nstring and simply twist it into a spiral, it would not hold the shape. Similarly, a strand of amino acids could not\nmaintain a stable spiral shape without the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions\nof the same strand (see Figure 2.26b). Less commonly, a polypeptide chain can form a beta-pleated sheet, in which\nhydrogen bonds form bridges between different regions of a single polypeptide that has folded back upon itself, or\nbetween two or more adjacent polypeptide chains.\nThe secondary structure of proteins further folds into a compact three-dimensional shape, referred to as the\nprotein’s tertiary structure (see Figure 2.26c). In this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the\nprimary chain can be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds.\nA disulfide bond is a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. Often, two or more separate\npolypeptides bond to form an even larger protein with a quaternary structure (see Figure 2.26d). The polypeptide\nsubunits forming a quaternary structure can be identical or different.', 'FIGURE 2.13\nEnzymes\nEnzymes decrease the activation energy required for a given chemical reaction to occur. (a) Without an enzyme,\nthe energy input needed for a reaction to begin is high. (b) With the help of an enzyme, less energy is needed for a reaction to begin.\nEnzymes are critical to the body’s healthy functioning. They assist, for example, with the breakdown of food and its\nconversion to energy. In fact, most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by enzymes.\n2.4 Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nCompare and contrast inorganic and organic compounds\n•\nIdentify the properties of water that make it essential to life\n•\nExplain the role of salts in body functioning\n•\nDistinguish between acids and bases, and explain their role in pH\n•\nDiscuss the role of buffers in helping the body maintain pH homeostasis\n54\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe concepts you have learned so far in this chapter govern all forms of matter, and would work as a foundation for\ngeology as well as biology. This section of the chapter narrows the focus to the chemistry of human life; that is, the\ncompounds important for the body’s structure and function. In general, these compounds are either inorganic or\norganic.\n•\nAn inorganic compound is a substance that does not contain both carbon and hydrogen. A great many\ninorganic compounds do contain hydrogen atoms, such as water (H2O) and the hydrochloric acid (HCl)\nproduced by your stomach. In contrast, only a handful of inorganic compounds contain carbon atoms. Carbon\ndioxide (CO2) is one of the few examples.\n•\nAn organic compound, then, is a substance that contains both carbon and hydrogen. Organic compounds are\nsynthesized via covalent bonds within living organisms, including the human body. Recall that carbon and\nhydrogen are the second and third most abundant elements in your body. You will soon discover how these two\nelements combine in the foods you eat, in the compounds that make up your body structure, and in the\nchemicals that fuel your functioning.', 'Brain cells are especially sensitive to lack of oxygen\nbecause of their requirement for a high-and-steady production of ATP. Brain damage is likely within five minutes\nwithout oxygen, and death is likely within ten minutes.\n16\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNutrients\nA nutrient is a substance in foods and beverages that is essential to human survival. The three basic classes of\nnutrients are water, the energy-yielding and body-building nutrients, and the micronutrients (vitamins and\nminerals).\nThe most critical nutrient is water. Depending on the environmental temperature and our state of health, we may be\nable to survive for only a few days without water. The body’s functional chemicals are dissolved and transported in\nwater, and the chemical reactions of life take place in water. Moreover, water is the largest component of cells,\nblood, and the fluid between cells, and water makes up about 70 percent of an adult’s body mass. Water also helps\nregulate our internal temperature and cushions, protects, and lubricates joints and many other body structures.\nThe energy-yielding nutrients are primarily carbohydrates and lipids, while proteins mainly supply the amino acids\nthat are the building blocks of the body itself. You ingest these in plant and animal foods and beverages, and the\ndigestive system breaks them down into molecules small enough to be absorbed. The breakdown products of\ncarbohydrates and lipids can then be used in the metabolic processes that convert them to ATP. Although you might\nfeel as if you are starving after missing a single meal, you can survive without consuming the energy-yielding\nnutrients for at least several weeks.\nWater and the energy-yielding nutrients are also referred to as macronutrients because the body needs them in\nlarge amounts. In contrast, micronutrients are vitamins and minerals. These elements and compounds participate in\nmany essential chemical reactions and processes, such as nerve impulses, and some, such as calcium, also\ncontribute to the body’s structure. Your body can store some of the micronutrients in its tissues, and draw on those\nreserves if you fail to consume them in your diet for a few days or weeks. Some others micronutrients, such as\nvitamin C and most of the B vitamins, are water-soluble and cannot be stored, so you need to consume them every\nday or two.']","The nine essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized by the body are histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine.",These are known as the essential amino acids

Muscle cells are excitable; they respond to a\nstimulus. They are contractile, meaning they can shorten and generate a pulling force. When attached between two\nmovable objects, in other words, bones, contractions of the muscles cause the bones to move. Some muscle\nmovement is voluntary, which means it is under conscious control. For example, a person decides to open a book\nand read a chapter on anatomy. Other movements are involuntary, meaning they are not under conscious control,\nsuch as the contraction of your pupil in bright light. Muscle tissue is classified into three types according to structure\nand function: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth (Table 4.2).', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.', 'Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands. Connective tissue, as its name implies, binds the\ncells and organs of the body together and functions in the protection, support, and integration of all parts of the\nbody. Muscle tissue is excitable, responding to stimulation and contracting to provide movement, and occurs as\nthree major types: skeletal (voluntary) muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle in the heart. Nervous tissue is\nalso excitable, allowing the propagation of electrochemical signals in the form of nerve impulses that communicate\nbetween different regions of the body (Figure 4.2).\nThe next level of organization is the organ, where several types of tissues come together to form a working unit. Just\nas knowing the structure and function of cells helps you in your study of tissues, knowledge of tissues will help you\nunderstand how organs function. The epithelial and connective tissues are discussed in detail in this chapter. Muscle\nand nervous tissues will be discussed only briefly in this chapter.\n126\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 4.2\nFour Types of Tissue: Body\nThe four types of tissues are exemplified in nervous tissue, stratified squamous epithelial\ntissue, cardiac muscle tissue, and connective tissue. (Micrographs provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School ©\n2012)\nEmbryonic Origin of Tissues\nThe zygote, or fertilized egg, is a single cell formed by the fusion of an egg and sperm. After fertilization the zygote\ngives rise to rapid mitotic cycles, generating many cells to form the embryo. The first embryonic cells generated\nhave the ability to differentiate into any type of cell in the body and, as such, are called totipotent, meaning each\nhas the capacity to divide, differentiate, and develop into a new organism.']","The three types of muscle tissue are skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle.","skeletal, cardiac, and smooth"
What is the number of chromosomes in a human diploid cell?,"['While there\nare a few cells in the body that do not undergo cell division (such as gametes, red blood cells, most neurons, and\nsome muscle cells), most somatic cells divide regularly. A somatic cell is a general term for a body cell, and all\nhuman cells, except for the cells that produce eggs and sperm (which are referred to as germ cells), are somatic\ncells. Somatic cells contain two copies of each of their chromosomes (one copy received from each parent). A\nhomologous pair of chromosomes is the two copies of a single chromosome found in each somatic cell. The human\nis a diploid organism, having 23 homologous pairs of chromosomes in each of the somatic cells. The condition of\nhaving pairs of chromosomes is known as diploidy.\nCells in the body replace themselves over the lifetime of a person. For example, the cells lining the gastrointestinal\ntract must be frequently replaced when constantly “worn off” by the movement of food through the gut. But what\ntriggers a cell to divide, and how does it prepare for and complete cell division? The cell cycle is the sequence of\nevents in the life of the cell from the moment it is created at the end of a previous cycle of cell division until it then\ndivides itself, generating two new cells.\n3.5 • Cell Growth and Division\n107\nThe Cell Cycle\nOne “turn” or cycle of the cell cycle consists of two general phases: interphase, followed by mitosis and cytokinesis.\nInterphase is the period of the cell cycle during which the cell is not dividing. The majority of cells are in interphase\nmost of the time. Mitosis is the division of genetic material, during which the cell nucleus breaks down and two new,\nfully functional, nuclei are formed. Cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm into two distinctive cells.\nInterphase\nA cell grows and carries out all normal metabolic functions and processes in a period called G1 (Figure 3.30). G1\nphase (gap 1 phase) is the first gap, or growth phase in the cell cycle. For cells that will divide again, G1 is followed\nby replication of the DNA, during the S phase. The S phase (synthesis phase) is period during which a cell replicates\nits DNA.', 'Therefore, after DNA replication but before cell division, each\ncell actually contains two copies of each chromosome. Each copy of the chromosome is referred to as a sister\nchromatid and is physically bound to the other copy.(Note that the term ""sister chromatid"" is used regardless of the\nsex of the person.) The centromere is the structure that attaches one sister chromatid to another. Because a human\ncell has 46 chromosomes, during this phase, there are 92 chromatids (46 × 2) in the cell. Make sure not to confuse\nthe concept of a pair of chromatids (one chromosome and its exact copy attached during mitosis) and a homologous\npair of chromosomes (two paired chromosomes which were inherited separately, one from each parent) (Figure\n3.31).\n108\n3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 3.31\nA Homologous Pair of Chromosomes with their Attached Sister Chromatids\nThe red and blue colors correspond to a\nhomologous pair of chromosomes. Each member of the pair was separately inherited from one parent. Each chromosome in the\nhomologous pair is also bound to an identical sister chromatid, which is produced by DNA replication, and results in the familiar “X” shape.\nMitosis and Cytokinesis\nThe mitotic phase of the cell typically takes between 1 and 2 hours. During this phase, a cell undergoes two major\nprocesses. First, it completes mitosis, during which the contents of the nucleus are equitably pulled apart and\ndistributed between its two halves. Cytokinesis then occurs, dividing the cytoplasm and cell body into two new cells.\nMitosis is divided into four major stages that take place after interphase (Figure 3.32) and in the following order:\nprophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The process is then followed by cytokinesis.\nFIGURE 3.32\nCell Division: Mitosis Followed by Cytokinesis\nThe stages of cell division oversee the separation of identical genetic\nmaterial into two new nuclei, followed by the division of the cytoplasm.\n3.5 • Cell Growth and Division\n109\nProphase is the first phase of mitosis, during which the loosely packed chromatin coils and condenses into visible\nchromosomes.', '158\n4 • Chapter Review\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nInteractive Link Questions\n1.

What is the pH of blood in a healthy adult?,"['These\ncompounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain\nboth hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and\ncushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a\nbyproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a\nreactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\nsolution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H+,\nthereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).\nThe pH of any solution is its relative concentration of\nH+. A solution with pH 7 is neutral. Solutions with pH\nbelow 7 are acids, and solutions with pH above 7 are\nbases. A change in a single digit on the pH scale (e.g.,\nfrom 7 to 8) represents a ten-fold increase or decrease\nin the concentration of H+. In a healthy adult, the pH of\nblood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45. Homeostatic control\nmechanisms important for keeping blood in a healthy\npH range include chemicals called buffers, weak acids\nand weak bases released when the pH of blood or\nother body fluids fluctuates in either direction outside\nof this normal range.\n2.5 Organic Compounds Essential to Human\nFunctioning\nOrganic compounds essential to human functioning\ninclude carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and\nnucleotides. These compounds are said to be organic\nbecause they contain both carbon and hydrogen.\nCarbon atoms in organic compounds readily share\nelectrons with hydrogen and other atoms, usually\noxygen, and sometimes nitrogen. Carbon atoms also\nmay bond with one or more functional groups such as\ncarboxyls, hydroxyls, aminos, or phosphates.\nMonomers are single units of organic compounds. They\nbond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which\ncan in turn be broken by hydrolysis.\nCarbohydrate compounds provide essential body fuel.\nTheir structural forms include monosaccharides such\nas glucose, disaccharides such as lactose, and\npolysaccharides, including starches (polymers of\nglucose), glycogen (the storage form of glucose), and\nfiber. All body cells can use glucose for fuel.', 'The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human\nurine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n59\nFIGURE 2.17\nThe pH Scale\nBuffers\nThe pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this\nslightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into\nthe bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids.', 'For example, a cell that should be programmed to self-destruct (a process called apoptosis) due to extensive\nDNA damage might instead be triggered to proliferate by an oncoprotein. On the other hand, a dysfunctional tumor\nsuppressor gene may fail to provide the cell with a necessary stop signal, also resulting in unwanted cell division and\nproliferation.\nA delicate homeostatic balance between the many proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes delicately\ncontrols the cell cycle and ensures that only healthy cells replicate. Therefore, a disruption of this homeostatic\nbalance can cause aberrant cell division and cancerous growths.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nVisit this link (http://openstax.org/l/mitosis) to learn about mitosis.

Throughout\ndevelopment and adulthood, the process of cellular differentiation leads cells to assume their final morphology and\nphysiology. Differentiation is the process by which unspecialized cells become specialized to carry out distinct\nfunctions.\nStem Cells\nA stem cell is an unspecialized cell that can divide without limit as needed and can, under specific conditions,\ndifferentiate into specialized cells. Stem cells are divided into several categories according to their potential to\ndifferentiate.\n112\n3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe first embryonic cells that arise from the division of the zygote are the ultimate stem cells; these stems cells are\ndescribed as totipotent because they have the potential to differentiate into any of the cells needed to enable an\norganism to grow and develop.\nThe embryonic cells that develop from totipotent stem cells and are precursors to the fundamental tissue layers of\nthe embryo are classified as pluripotent.', '(b) In aqueous solution, a base dissociates into hydroxyl ions (OH–) and\ncations. Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–.\nBases\nA base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+ already present in\nsolution (see Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine\nwith H+ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+ and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases\nrelease most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H+. Food\nmixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract\nafter the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3–), a weak base that attracts H+. Bicarbonate\naccepts some of the H+ protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.\nThe Concept of pH\nThe relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution’s pH is the negative, base-10\nlogarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+\nconcentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times\nmore acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH.', 'FIGURE 2.13\nEnzymes\nEnzymes decrease the activation energy required for a given chemical reaction to occur. (a) Without an enzyme,\nthe energy input needed for a reaction to begin is high. (b) With the help of an enzyme, less energy is needed for a reaction to begin.\nEnzymes are critical to the body’s healthy functioning. They assist, for example, with the breakdown of food and its\nconversion to energy. In fact, most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by enzymes.\n2.4 Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nCompare and contrast inorganic and organic compounds\n•\nIdentify the properties of water that make it essential to life\n•\nExplain the role of salts in body functioning\n•\nDistinguish between acids and bases, and explain their role in pH\n•\nDiscuss the role of buffers in helping the body maintain pH homeostasis\n54\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe concepts you have learned so far in this chapter govern all forms of matter, and would work as a foundation for\ngeology as well as biology. This section of the chapter narrows the focus to the chemistry of human life; that is, the\ncompounds important for the body’s structure and function. In general, these compounds are either inorganic or\norganic.\n•\nAn inorganic compound is a substance that does not contain both carbon and hydrogen. A great many\ninorganic compounds do contain hydrogen atoms, such as water (H2O) and the hydrochloric acid (HCl)\nproduced by your stomach. In contrast, only a handful of inorganic compounds contain carbon atoms. Carbon\ndioxide (CO2) is one of the few examples.\n•\nAn organic compound, then, is a substance that contains both carbon and hydrogen. Organic compounds are\nsynthesized via covalent bonds within living organisms, including the human body. Recall that carbon and\nhydrogen are the second and third most abundant elements in your body. You will soon discover how these two\nelements combine in the foods you eat, in the compounds that make up your body structure, and in the\nchemicals that fuel your functioning.']","The pH of blood in a healthy adult ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, typically identified as pH 7.4.",7.35 to 7.45
What are the three structural forms of carbohydrate compounds?,"['Monomers are single units of organic compounds. They\nbond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which\ncan in turn be broken by hydrolysis.\nCarbohydrate compounds provide essential body fuel.\nTheir structural forms include monosaccharides such\nas glucose, disaccharides such as lactose, and\npolysaccharides, including starches (polymers of\nglucose), glycogen (the storage form of glucose), and\nfiber. All body cells can use glucose for fuel. It is\nconverted via an oxidation-reduction reaction to ATP.\nLipids are hydrophobic compounds that provide body\nfuel and are important components of many biological\ncompounds. Triglycerides are the most abundant lipid\nin the body, and are composed of a glycerol backbone\nattached to three fatty acid chains. Phospholipids are\ncompounds composed of a diglyceride with a\nphosphate group attached at the molecule’s head. The\nresult is a molecule with polar and nonpolar regions.\nSteroids are lipids formed of four hydrocarbon rings.\nThe most important is cholesterol. Prostaglandins are\nsignaling molecules derived from unsaturated fatty\nacids.\nProteins are critical components of all body tissues.\nThey are made up of monomers called amino acids,\nwhich contain nitrogen, joined by peptide bonds.\nProtein shape is critical to its function. Most body\nproteins are globular. An example is enzymes, which\ncatalyze chemical reactions.\n2 • Chapter Review\n77\nNucleotides are compounds with three building blocks:\none or more phosphate groups, a pentose sugar, and a\nnitrogen-containing base. DNA and RNA are nucleic\nacids that function in protein synthesis. ATP is the\nbody’s fundamental molecule of energy transfer.\nRemoval or addition of phosphates releases or invests\nenergy.\nInteractive Link Questions\n1. Visit this website (http://openstax.org/l/ptable) to\nview the periodic table. In the periodic table of the\nelements, elements in a single column have the\nsame number of electrons that can participate in a\nchemical reaction.', 'As was noted earlier, this reaction\nresults in the release of a molecule of water. Each monomer contributes: One gives up a hydrogen atom and the\nother gives up a hydroxyl group. Polymers are split into monomers by hydrolysis (-lysis = “rupture”). The bonds\nbetween their monomers are broken, via the donation of a molecule of water, which contributes a hydrogen atom to\none monomer and a hydroxyl group to the other.\nCarbohydrates\nThe term carbohydrate means “hydrated carbon.” Recall that the root hydro- indicates water. A carbohydrate is a\nmolecule composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; in most carbohydrates, hydrogen and oxygen are found in the\nsame two-to-one relative proportions they have in water. In fact, the chemical formula for a “generic” molecule of\ncarbohydrate is (CH2O)n.\nCarbohydrates are referred to as saccharides, a word meaning “sugars.” Three forms are important in the body.\nMonosaccharides are the monomers of carbohydrates. Disaccharides (di- = “two”) are made up of two monomers.\nPolysaccharides are the polymers, and can consist of hundreds to thousands of monomers.\nMonosaccharides\nA monosaccharide is a monomer of carbohydrates. Five monosaccharides are important in the body. Three of these\nare the hexose sugars, so called because they each contain six atoms of carbon. These are glucose, fructose, and\ngalactose, shown in Figure 2.18a. The remaining monosaccharides are the two pentose sugars, each of which\ncontains five atoms of carbon. They are ribose and deoxyribose, shown in Figure 2.18b.\n62\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 2.18\nFive Important Monosaccharides\nDisaccharides\nA disaccharide is a pair of monosaccharides. Disaccharides are formed via dehydration synthesis, and the bond\nlinking them is referred to as a glycosidic bond (glyco- = “sugar”). Three disaccharides (shown in Figure 2.19) are\nimportant to humans.', 'It is not considered a dietary carbohydrate because very little glycogen remains in animal tissues after\nslaughter; however, the human body stores excess glucose as glycogen, again, in the muscles and liver.\n•\nCellulose, a polysaccharide that is the primary component of the cell wall of green plants, is the component of\nplant food referred to as “fiber”. In humans, cellulose/fiber is not digestible; however, dietary fiber has many\nhealth benefits. It helps you feel full so you eat less, it promotes a healthy digestive tract, and a diet high in fiber\nis thought to reduce the risk of heart disease and possibly some forms of cancer.\nFIGURE 2.20\nThree Important Polysaccharides\nThree important polysaccharides are starches, glycogen, and fiber.\nFunctions of Carbohydrates\nThe body obtains carbohydrates from plant-based foods. Grains, fruits, and legumes and other vegetables provide\nmost of the carbohydrate in the human diet, although lactose is found in dairy products.\nAlthough most body cells can break down other organic compounds for fuel, all body cells can use glucose.\nMoreover, nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, spinal cord, and through the peripheral nervous system, as well as red\nblood cells, can use only glucose for fuel. In the breakdown of glucose for energy, molecules of adenosine\ntriphosphate, better known as ATP, are produced. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is composed of a ribose sugar, an\nadenine base, and three phosphate groups. ATP releases free energy when its phosphate bonds are broken, and\nthus supplies ready energy to the cell. More ATP is produced in the presence of oxygen (O2) than in pathways that do\nnot use oxygen. The overall reaction for the conversion of the energy in glucose to energy stored in ATP can be\nwritten:\nIn addition to being a critical fuel source, carbohydrates are present in very small amounts in cells’ structure. For\ninstance, some carbohydrate molecules bind with proteins to produce glycoproteins, and others combine with lipids\nto produce glycolipids, both of which are found in the membrane that encloses the contents of body cells.\nLipids\nA lipid is one of a highly diverse group of compounds made up mostly of hydrocarbons.', 'Other diseases believed to be triggered or\nexacerbated by ROS include Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, arthritis,\nHuntington’s disease, and schizophrenia, among many others. It is noteworthy that these diseases are largely age-\nrelated. Many scientists believe that oxidative stress is a major contributor to the aging process.\nAging and the...\nCell: The Free Radical Theory\nThe free radical theory on aging was originally proposed in the 1950s, and still remains under debate. Generally\nspeaking, the free radical theory of aging suggests that accumulated cellular damage from oxidative stress\ncontributes to the physiological and anatomical effects of aging. There are two significantly different versions of\nthis theory: one states that the aging process itself is a result of oxidative damage, and the other states that\noxidative damage causes age-related disease and disorders. The latter version of the theory is more widely\n96\n3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe Cytoskeleton\nMuch like the bony skeleton structurally supports the human body, the cytoskeleton helps the cells to maintain their\nstructural integrity. The cytoskeleton is a group of fibrous proteins that provide structural support for cells, but this\nis only one of the functions of the cytoskeleton. Cytoskeletal components are also critical for cell motility, cell\nreproduction, and transportation of substances within the cell.\nThe cytoskeleton forms a complex thread-like network throughout the cell consisting of three different kinds of\nprotein-based filaments: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules (Figure 3.18). The thickest of the\nthree is the microtubule, a structural filament composed of subunits of a protein called tubulin. Microtubules\nmaintain cell shape and structure, help resist compression of the cell, and play a role in positioning the organelles\nwithin the cell. Microtubules also make up two types of cellular appendages important for motion: cilia and flagella.\nCilia are found on many cells of the body, including the epithelial cells that line the airways of the respiratory\nsystem. Cilia move rhythmically; they beat constantly, moving waste materials such as dust, mucus, and bacteria\nupward through the airways, away from the lungs and toward the mouth.', 'These\ncompounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain\nboth hydrogen and carbon.

What is the pH of...,"['The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human\nurine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n59\nFIGURE 2.17\nThe pH Scale\nBuffers\nThe pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this\nslightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into\nthe bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids.', '(b) In aqueous solution, a base dissociates into hydroxyl ions (OH–) and\ncations.
