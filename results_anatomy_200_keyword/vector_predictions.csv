What is the pH of blood?,"['The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human\nurine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n59\nFIGURE 2.17\nThe pH Scale\nBuffers\nThe pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this\nslightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into\nthe bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids.', 'This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids. For example, if there is\neven a slight decrease below 7.35 in the pH of a bodily fluid, the buffer in the fluid—in this case, acting as a weak\nbase—will bind the excess hydrogen ions. In contrast, if pH rises above 7.45, the buffer will act as a weak acid and\ncontribute hydrogen ions.\n60\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nHOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCES\nAcids and Bases\nExcessive acidity of the blood and other body fluids is known as acidosis. Common causes of acidosis are situations\nand disorders that reduce the effectiveness of breathing, especially the person’s ability to exhale fully, which causes\na buildup of CO2 (and H+) in the bloodstream. Acidosis can also be caused by metabolic problems that reduce the\nlevel or function of buffers that act as bases, or that promote the production of acids. For instance, with severe\ndiarrhea, too much bicarbonate can be lost from the body, allowing acids to build up in body fluids. In people with\npoorly managed diabetes (ineffective regulation of blood sugar), acids called ketones are produced as a form of\nbody fuel. These can build up in the blood, causing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Kidney failure,\nliver failure, heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.\nIn contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic). As with\nacidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low.\nLung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the\nnormal concentration of H+.', '(b) In aqueous solution, a base dissociates into hydroxyl ions (OH–) and\ncations. Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–.\nBases\nA base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+ already present in\nsolution (see Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine\nwith H+ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+ and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases\nrelease most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H+. Food\nmixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract\nafter the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3–), a weak base that attracts H+. Bicarbonate\naccepts some of the H+ protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.\nThe Concept of pH\nThe relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution’s pH is the negative, base-10\nlogarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+\nconcentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times\nmore acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH.', 'These\ncompounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain\nboth hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and\ncushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a\nbyproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a\nreactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\nsolution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H+,\nthereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).\nThe pH of any solution is its relative concentration of\nH+. A solution with pH 7 is neutral. Solutions with pH\nbelow 7 are acids, and solutions with pH above 7 are\nbases. A change in a single digit on the pH scale (e.g.,\nfrom 7 to 8) represents a ten-fold increase or decrease\nin the concentration of H+. In a healthy adult, the pH of\nblood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45. Homeostatic control\nmechanisms important for keeping blood in a healthy\npH range include chemicals called buffers, weak acids\nand weak bases released when the pH of blood or\nother body fluids fluctuates in either direction outside\nof this normal range.\n2.5 Organic Compounds Essential to Human\nFunctioning\nOrganic compounds essential to human functioning\ninclude carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and\nnucleotides. These compounds are said to be organic\nbecause they contain both carbon and hydrogen.\nCarbon atoms in organic compounds readily share\nelectrons with hydrogen and other atoms, usually\noxygen, and sometimes nitrogen. Carbon atoms also\nmay bond with one or more functional groups such as\ncarboxyls, hydroxyls, aminos, or phosphates.\nMonomers are single units of organic compounds. They\nbond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which\ncan in turn be broken by hydrolysis.\nCarbohydrate compounds provide essential body fuel.\nTheir structural forms include monosaccharides such\nas glucose, disaccharides such as lactose, and\npolysaccharides, including starches (polymers of\nglucose), glycogen (the storage form of glucose), and\nfiber. All body cells can use glucose for fuel.', 'Immediate treatment is with\npure oxygen. The affected person is then moved into a hyperbaric chamber. A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,\nclosed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body\nso that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to\nthe body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing\nsome of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.\nThe dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the\npressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body\ntissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the\npulsating flow of pressurized blood.\n1.5 Homeostasis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning\n•\nContrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism\nMaintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body\ntemperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point.\nA set point is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set\nof values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is\napproximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to\nfluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a).']","The pH of blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, with a typical value identified as pH 7.4.",7.35-7.45

For example, multicellular protists, ancient eukaryotes, do not have\ncells organized into tissues.\nAlthough there are many types of cells in the human body, they are organized into four broad categories of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease.

Merocrine secretion is the most common type of\nexocrine secretion. The secretions are enclosed in vesicles that move to the apical surface of the cell where the\ncontents are released by exocytosis. For example, watery mucous containing the glycoprotein mucin, a lubricant\nthat offers some pathogen protection is a merocrine secretion. The eccrine glands that produce and secrete sweat\nare another example.\n138\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 4.10\nModes of Glandular Secretion\n(a) In merocrine secretion, the cell remains intact. (b) In apocrine secretion, the apical\nportion of the cell is released, as well. (c) In holocrine secretion, the cell is destroyed as it releases its product and the cell itself becomes\npart of the secretion.\nApocrine secretion accumulates near the apical portion of the cell. That portion of the cell and its secretory\ncontents pinch off from the cell and are released. Apocrine sweat glands in the axillary and genital areas release\nfatty secretions that local bacteria break down; this causes body odor. Both merocrine and apocrine glands continue\nto produce and secrete their contents with little damage caused to the cell because the nucleus and golgi regions\nremain intact after secretion.\nIn contrast, the process of holocrine secretion involves the rupture and destruction of the entire gland cell. The cell\naccumulates its secretory products and releases them only when it bursts. New gland cells differentiate from cells\nin the surrounding tissue to replace those lost by secretion. The sebaceous glands that produce the oils on the skin\nand hair are holocrine glands/cells (Figure 4.11).\n4.2 • Epithelial Tissue\n139\nFIGURE 4.11\nSebaceous Glands\nThese glands secrete oils that lubricate and protect the skin. They are holocrine glands and they are\ndestroyed after releasing their contents. New glandular cells form to replace the cells that are lost. LM × 400.', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.', 'The four types most important to human structure and function are carbohydrates,\nlipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Before exploring these compounds, you need to first understand the chemistry of\ncarbon.\nThe Chemistry of Carbon\nWhat makes organic compounds ubiquitous is the chemistry of their carbon core. Recall that carbon atoms have four\nelectrons in their valence shell, and that the octet rule dictates that atoms tend to react in such a way as to\ncomplete their valence shell with eight electrons. Carbon atoms do not complete their valence shells by donating or\naccepting four electrons. Instead, they readily share electrons via covalent bonds.\nCommonly, carbon atoms share with other carbon atoms, often forming a long carbon chain referred to as a carbon\nskeleton. When they do share, however, they do not share all their electrons exclusively with each other. Rather,\ncarbon atoms tend to share electrons with a variety of other elements, one of which is always hydrogen. Carbon and\nhydrogen groupings are called hydrocarbons. If you study the figures of organic compounds in the remainder of this\nchapter, you will see several with chains of hydrocarbons in one region of the compound.\nMany combinations are possible to fill carbon’s four “vacancies.” Carbon may share electrons with oxygen or\nnitrogen or other atoms in a particular region of an organic compound. Moreover, the atoms to which carbon atoms\nbond may also be part of a functional group. A functional group is a group of atoms linked by strong covalent bonds\n2.5 • Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n61\nand tending to function in chemical reactions as a single unit. You can think of functional groups as tightly knit\n“cliques” whose members are unlikely to be parted. Five functional groups are important in human physiology;\nthese are the hydroxyl, carboxyl, amino, methyl and phosphate groups (Table 2.1).\nFunctional Groups Important in Human Physiology\nFunctional\ngroup\nStructural\nformula\nImportance\nHydroxyl\n—O—H\nHydroxyl groups are polar. They are components of all four types of organic\ncompounds discussed in this chapter. They are involved in dehydration\nsynthesis and hydrolysis reactions.\nCarboxyl\nCarboxyl groups are found within fatty acids, amino acids, and many other\nacids.']","The three main types of muscle tissue are skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle. Skeletal muscle is under voluntary control and enables movement of bones, cardiac muscle is involuntary and makes up the heart, while smooth muscle is also involuntary and is found in the walls of hollow organs."," Bone, Axial Skeleton, and Appendicular Skeleton"
What is the pH of blood?,"['The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human\nurine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n59\nFIGURE 2.17\nThe pH Scale\nBuffers\nThe pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this\nslightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into\nthe bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids.', 'This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4.

A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids. For example, if there is\neven a slight decrease below 7.35 in the pH of a bodily fluid, the buffer in the fluid—in this case, acting as a weak\nbase—will bind the excess hydrogen ions. In contrast, if pH rises above 7.45, the buffer will act as a weak acid and\ncontribute hydrogen ions.\n60\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nHOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCES\nAcids and Bases\nExcessive acidity of the blood and other body fluids is known as acidosis. Common causes of acidosis are situations\nand disorders that reduce the effectiveness of breathing, especially the person’s ability to exhale fully, which causes\na buildup of CO2 (and H+) in the bloodstream. Acidosis can also be caused by metabolic problems that reduce the\nlevel or function of buffers that act as bases, or that promote the production of acids. For instance, with severe\ndiarrhea, too much bicarbonate can be lost from the body, allowing acids to build up in body fluids. In people with\npoorly managed diabetes (ineffective regulation of blood sugar), acids called ketones are produced as a form of\nbody fuel. These can build up in the blood, causing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Kidney failure,\nliver failure, heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.\nIn contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic). As with\nacidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low.\nLung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the\nnormal concentration of H+.', '(b) In aqueous solution, a base dissociates into hydroxyl ions (OH–) and\ncations. Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–.\nBases\nA base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+ already present in\nsolution (see Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine\nwith H+ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+ and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases\nrelease most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H+. Food\nmixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract\nafter the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3–), a weak base that attracts H+. Bicarbonate\naccepts some of the H+ protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.\nThe Concept of pH\nThe relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution’s pH is the negative, base-10\nlogarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+\nconcentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times\nmore acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH.', 'These\ncompounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain\nboth hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and\ncushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a\nbyproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a\nreactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\nsolution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H+,\nthereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).\nThe pH of any solution is its relative concentration of\nH+. A solution with pH 7 is neutral. Solutions with pH\nbelow 7 are acids, and solutions with pH above 7 are\nbases. A change in a single digit on the pH scale (e.g.,\nfrom 7 to 8) represents a ten-fold increase or decrease\nin the concentration of H+. In a healthy adult, the pH of\nblood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45. Homeostatic control\nmechanisms important for keeping blood in a healthy\npH range include chemicals called buffers, weak acids\nand weak bases released when the pH of blood or\nother body fluids fluctuates in either direction outside\nof this normal range.\n2.5 Organic Compounds Essential to Human\nFunctioning\nOrganic compounds essential to human functioning\ninclude carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and\nnucleotides. These compounds are said to be organic\nbecause they contain both carbon and hydrogen.\nCarbon atoms in organic compounds readily share\nelectrons with hydrogen and other atoms, usually\noxygen, and sometimes nitrogen. Carbon atoms also\nmay bond with one or more functional groups such as\ncarboxyls, hydroxyls, aminos, or phosphates.\nMonomers are single units of organic compounds. They\nbond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which\ncan in turn be broken by hydrolysis.\nCarbohydrate compounds provide essential body fuel.\nTheir structural forms include monosaccharides such\nas glucose, disaccharides such as lactose, and\npolysaccharides, including starches (polymers of\nglucose), glycogen (the storage form of glucose), and\nfiber. All body cells can use glucose for fuel.', 'Immediate treatment is with\npure oxygen. The affected person is then moved into a hyperbaric chamber. A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,\nclosed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body\nso that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to\nthe body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing\nsome of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.\nThe dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the\npressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body\ntissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the\npulsating flow of pressurized blood.\n1.5 Homeostasis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning\n•\nContrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism\nMaintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body\ntemperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point.\nA set point is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set\nof values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is\napproximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to\nfluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a).']","The pH of blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, with a typical value identified as pH 7.4.",7.35-7.45

The cells within a tissue share a\ncommon embryonic origin. Microscopic observation reveals that the cells in a tissue share morphological features\nand are arranged in an orderly pattern that achieves the tissue’s functions. From the evolutionary perspective,\ntissues appear in more complex organisms. For example, multicellular protists, ancient eukaryotes, do not have\ncells organized into tissues.\nAlthough there are many types of cells in the human body, they are organized into four broad categories of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands.', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.']","The three types of muscle tissue are skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle.","skeletal, cardiac, and smooth"
What is the pH range of normal human blood?,"['The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human\nurine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n59\nFIGURE 2.17\nThe pH Scale\nBuffers\nThe pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this\nslightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into\nthe bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids.', 'This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4.

A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids. For example, if there is\neven a slight decrease below 7.35 in the pH of a bodily fluid, the buffer in the fluid—in this case, acting as a weak\nbase—will bind the excess hydrogen ions. In contrast, if pH rises above 7.45, the buffer will act as a weak acid and\ncontribute hydrogen ions.\n60\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nHOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCES\nAcids and Bases\nExcessive acidity of the blood and other body fluids is known as acidosis. Common causes of acidosis are situations\nand disorders that reduce the effectiveness of breathing, especially the person’s ability to exhale fully, which causes\na buildup of CO2 (and H+) in the bloodstream. Acidosis can also be caused by metabolic problems that reduce the\nlevel or function of buffers that act as bases, or that promote the production of acids. For instance, with severe\ndiarrhea, too much bicarbonate can be lost from the body, allowing acids to build up in body fluids. In people with\npoorly managed diabetes (ineffective regulation of blood sugar), acids called ketones are produced as a form of\nbody fuel. These can build up in the blood, causing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Kidney failure,\nliver failure, heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.\nIn contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic). As with\nacidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low.\nLung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the\nnormal concentration of H+.', '(b) In aqueous solution, a base dissociates into hydroxyl ions (OH–) and\ncations. Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–.\nBases\nA base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+ already present in\nsolution (see Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine\nwith H+ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+ and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases\nrelease most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H+. Food\nmixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract\nafter the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3–), a weak base that attracts H+. Bicarbonate\naccepts some of the H+ protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.\nThe Concept of pH\nThe relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution’s pH is the negative, base-10\nlogarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+\nconcentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times\nmore acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH.', 'These\ncompounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain\nboth hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and\ncushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a\nbyproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a\nreactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\nsolution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H+,\nthereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).\nThe pH of any solution is its relative concentration of\nH+. A solution with pH 7 is neutral. Solutions with pH\nbelow 7 are acids, and solutions with pH above 7 are\nbases. A change in a single digit on the pH scale (e.g.,\nfrom 7 to 8) represents a ten-fold increase or decrease\nin the concentration of H+. In a healthy adult, the pH of\nblood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45. Homeostatic control\nmechanisms important for keeping blood in a healthy\npH range include chemicals called buffers, weak acids\nand weak bases released when the pH of blood or\nother body fluids fluctuates in either direction outside\nof this normal range.\n2.5 Organic Compounds Essential to Human\nFunctioning\nOrganic compounds essential to human functioning\ninclude carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and\nnucleotides. These compounds are said to be organic\nbecause they contain both carbon and hydrogen.\nCarbon atoms in organic compounds readily share\nelectrons with hydrogen and other atoms, usually\noxygen, and sometimes nitrogen. Carbon atoms also\nmay bond with one or more functional groups such as\ncarboxyls, hydroxyls, aminos, or phosphates.\nMonomers are single units of organic compounds. They\nbond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which\ncan in turn be broken by hydrolysis.\nCarbohydrate compounds provide essential body fuel.\nTheir structural forms include monosaccharides such\nas glucose, disaccharides such as lactose, and\npolysaccharides, including starches (polymers of\nglucose), glycogen (the storage form of glucose), and\nfiber. All body cells can use glucose for fuel.', 'Immediate treatment is with\npure oxygen. The affected person is then moved into a hyperbaric chamber. A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,\nclosed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body\nso that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to\nthe body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing\nsome of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.\nThe dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the\npressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body\ntissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the\npulsating flow of pressurized blood.\n1.5 Homeostasis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning\n•\nContrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism\nMaintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body\ntemperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point.\nA set point is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set\nof values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is\napproximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to\nfluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a).']","The pH range of normal human blood is between 7.35 and 7.45, typically identified as pH 7.4.",7.35-7.45

Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands.', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.']","The three types of muscle tissue are skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle.","skeletal, cardiac, and smooth"
What are the three major effects of stimulation of the heat-loss center?,"['Thus, the\nsweat on the skin’s surface is not able to evaporate, and internal body temperature can get dangerously high.\n1.4 • Requirements for Human Life\n17\nFIGURE 1.8\nExtreme Heat\nHumans acclimate to some degree to repeated exposure to high temperatures. (credit: McKay Savage/flickr)\nThe body can also respond effectively to short-term exposure to cold. One response to cold is shivering, which is\nrandom muscle movement that generates heat. Another response is increased breakdown of stored energy to\ngenerate heat. When that energy reserve is depleted, however, and the core temperature begins to drop\nsignificantly, red blood cells will lose their ability to give up oxygen, denying the brain of this critical component of\nATP production. This lack of oxygen can cause confusion, lethargy, and eventually loss of consciousness and death.\nThe body responds to cold by reducing blood circulation to the extremities, the hands and feet, in order to prevent\nblood from cooling there and so that the body’s core can stay warm. Even when core body temperature remains\nstable, however, tissues exposed to severe cold, especially the fingers and toes, can develop frostbite when blood\nflow to the extremities has been much reduced. This form of tissue damage can be permanent and lead to gangrene,\nrequiring amputation of the affected region.\nEveryday Connection\nControlled Hypothermia\nAs you have learned, the body continuously engages in coordinated physiological processes to maintain a stable\ntemperature. In some cases, however, overriding this system can be useful, or even life-saving. Hypothermia is\nthe clinical term for an abnormally low body temperature (hypo- = “below” or “under”). Controlled hypothermia\nis clinically induced hypothermia performed in order to reduce the metabolic rate of an organ or of a person’s\nentire body.\nControlled hypothermia often is used, for example, during open-heart surgery because it decreases the\nmetabolic needs of the brain, heart, and other organs, reducing the risk of damage to them. When controlled\nhypothermia is used clinically, the patient is given medication to prevent shivering. The body is then cooled to\n25–32°C (79–89°F). The heart is stopped and an external heart-lung pump maintains circulation to the patient’s\nbody.', 'The insulin signals skeletal muscle fibers, fat cells (adipocytes), and liver cells to take up the excess glucose,\nremoving it from the bloodstream. As glucose concentration in the bloodstream drops, the decrease in\nconcentration—the actual negative feedback—is detected by pancreatic alpha cells, and insulin release stops. This\nprevents blood sugar levels from continuing to drop below the normal range.\nHumans have a similar temperature regulation feedback system that works by promoting either heat loss or heat\ngain (Figure 1.10b). When the brain’s temperature regulation center receives data from the sensors indicating that\nthe body’s temperature exceeds its normal range, it stimulates a cluster of brain cells referred to as the “heat-loss\ncenter.” This stimulation has three major effects:\n•\nBlood vessels in the skin begin to dilate allowing more blood from the body core to flow to the surface of the\nskin allowing the heat to radiate into the environment.\n•\nAs blood flow to the skin increases, sweat glands are activated to increase their output. As the sweat\nevaporates from the skin surface into the surrounding air, it takes heat with it.\n•\nThe depth of respiration increases, and a person may breathe through an open mouth instead of through the\nnasal passageways. This further increases heat loss from the lungs.\nIn contrast, activation of the brain’s heat-gain center by exposure to cold reduces blood flow to the skin, and blood\nreturning from the limbs is diverted into a network of deep veins. This arrangement traps heat closer to the body\ncore and restricts heat loss. If heat loss is severe, the brain triggers an increase in random signals to skeletal\nmuscles, causing them to contract and producing shivering. The muscle contractions of shivering release heat while\nusing up ATP. The brain triggers the thyroid gland in the endocrine system to release thyroid hormone, which\nincreases metabolic activity and heat production in cells throughout the body. The brain also signals the adrenal\nglands to release epinephrine (adrenaline), a hormone that causes the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which\ncan be used as an energy source. The breakdown of glycogen into glucose also results in increased metabolism and\nheat production.\n1.5 • Homeostasis\n21\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nWater concentration in the body is critical for proper functioning.', 'Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a). A sensor, also referred to a receptor, is a\ncomponent of a feedback system that monitors a physiological value. This value is reported to the control center.\nThe control center is the component in a feedback system that compares the value to the normal range. If the value\ndeviates too much from the set point, then the control center activates an effector. An effector is the component in\na feedback system that causes a change to reverse the situation and return the value to the normal range.\n20\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 1.10\nNegative Feedback System\nIn a negative feedback system, a stimulus—a deviation from a set point—is resisted through\na physiological process that returns the body to homeostasis. (a) A negative feedback system has five basic parts. (b) Body temperature is\nregulated by negative feedback.\nIn order to set the system in motion, a stimulus must drive a physiological parameter beyond its normal range (that\nis, beyond homeostasis). This stimulus is “heard” by a specific sensor. For example, in the control of blood glucose,\nspecific endocrine cells in the pancreas detect excess glucose (the stimulus) in the bloodstream. These pancreatic\nbeta cells respond to the increased level of blood glucose by releasing the hormone insulin into the bloodstream.\nThe insulin signals skeletal muscle fibers, fat cells (adipocytes), and liver cells to take up the excess glucose,\nremoving it from the bloodstream. As glucose concentration in the bloodstream drops, the decrease in\nconcentration—the actual negative feedback—is detected by pancreatic alpha cells, and insulin release stops.

LM × 100. (credit: “Wbensmith”/Wikimedia Commons)\nThermoregulation\nThe integumentary system helps regulate body temperature through its tight association with the sympathetic\nnervous system, the division of the nervous system involved in our fight-or-flight responses. The sympathetic\nnervous system is continuously monitoring body temperature and initiating appropriate motor responses. Recall\nthat sweat glands, accessory structures to the skin, secrete water, salt, and other substances to cool the body when\nit becomes warm. Even when the body does not appear to be noticeably sweating, approximately 500 mL of sweat\n(insensible perspiration) are secreted a day. If the body becomes excessively warm due to high temperatures,\nvigorous activity (Figure 5.16ac), or a combination of the two, sweat glands will be stimulated by the sympathetic\nnervous system to produce large amounts of sweat, as much as 0.7 to 1.5 L per hour for an active person. When the\nsweat evaporates from the skin surface, the body is cooled as body heat is dissipated.\nIn addition to sweating, arterioles in the dermis dilate so that excess heat carried by the blood can dissipate through\nthe skin and into the surrounding environment (Figure 5.16b). This accounts for the skin redness that many people\nexperience when exercising.\n178\n5 • The Integumentary System\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 5.16\nThermoregulation\nDuring strenuous physical activities, such as skiing (a) or running (c), the dermal blood vessels dilate\nand sweat secretion increases (b).

These glands are\nfound all over the skin’s surface, but are especially abundant on the palms of the hand, the soles of the feet, and the\nforehead (Figure 5.14). They are coiled glands lying deep in the dermis, with the duct rising up to a pore on the skin\nsurface, where the sweat is released. This type of sweat, released by exocytosis, is hypotonic and composed mostly\nof water, with some salt, antibodies, traces of metabolic waste, and dermicidin, an antimicrobial peptide.

Apocrine sweat glands are larger than eccrine sweat glands and lie deeper in the dermis, sometimes even\nreaching the hypodermis, with the duct normally emptying into the hair follicle. In addition to water and salts,\napocrine sweat includes organic compounds that make the sweat thicker and subject to bacterial decomposition\nand subsequent smell. The release of this sweat is under both nervous and hormonal control, and plays a role in the\npoorly understood human pheromone response. Most commercial antiperspirants use an aluminum-based\ncompound as their primary active ingredient to stop sweat. When the antiperspirant enters the sweat gland duct,\nthe aluminum-based compounds precipitate due to a change in pH and form a physical block in the duct, which\nprevents sweat from coming out of the pore.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nSweating regulates body temperature.

This stored fat\ncan serve as an energy reserve, insulate the body to prevent heat loss, and act as a cushion to protect underlying\nstructures from trauma.\nWhere the fat is deposited and accumulates within the hypodermis depends on hormones (testosterone,\nestrogen, insulin, glucagon, leptin, and others), as well as genetic factors. Fat distribution changes as our bodies\nmature and age. Males tend to accumulate fat in different areas (neck, arms, lower back, and abdomen) than do\nfemales (breasts, hips, thighs, and buttocks). The body mass index (BMI) is often used as a measure of fat,\nalthough this measure is, in fact, derived from a mathematical formula that compares body weight (mass) to\nheight. Therefore, its accuracy as a health indicator can be called into question in individuals who are extremely\nphysically fit.\nIn many animals, there is a pattern of storing excess calories as fat to be used in times when food is not readily\navailable. In much of the developed world, insufficient exercise coupled with the ready availability and\nconsumption of high-calorie foods have resulted in unwanted accumulations of adipose tissue in many people.\nAlthough periodic accumulation of excess fat may have provided an evolutionary advantage to our ancestors,\nwho experienced unpredictable bouts of famine, it is now becoming chronic and considered a major health\nthreat. Recent studies indicate that a distressing percentage of our population is overweight and/or clinically\nobese. Not only is this a problem for the individuals affected, but it also has a severe impact on our healthcare\nsystem. Changes in lifestyle, specifically in diet and exercise, are the best ways to control body fat accumulation,\nespecially when it reaches levels that increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes.\n5.1 • Layers of the Skin\n169\nFIGURE 5.8\nSkin Pigmentation\nThe relative coloration of the skin depends of the amount of melanin produced by melanocytes in the\nstratum basale and taken up by keratinocytes.\nMelanin occurs in two primary forms.

What is the name of the protein found in red blood cells?,"['Some integral membrane proteins are glycoproteins. A glycoprotein is a protein that has carbohydrate molecules\nattached, which extend into the extracellular matrix. The attached carbohydrate tags on glycoproteins aid in cell\nrecognition. The carbohydrates that extend from membrane proteins and even from some membrane lipids\ncollectively form the glycocalyx. The glycocalyx is a fuzzy-appearing coating around the cell formed from\nglycoproteins and other carbohydrates attached to the cell membrane. The glycocalyx can have various roles. For\nexample, it may have molecules that allow the cell to bind to another cell, it may contain receptors for hormones, or\nit might have enzymes to break down nutrients. The glycocalyces found in a person’s body are products of that\nperson’s genetic makeup. They give each of the individual’s trillions of cells the “identity” of belonging in the\nperson’s body. This identity is the primary way that a person’s immune defense cells “know” not to attack the\nperson’s own body cells, but it also is the reason organs donated by another person might be rejected.\nPeripheral proteins are typically found on the inner or outer surface of the lipid bilayer but can also be attached to\nthe internal or external surface of an integral protein. These proteins typically perform a specific function for the\ncell. Some peripheral proteins on the surface of intestinal cells, for example, act as digestive enzymes to break down\nnutrients to sizes that can pass through the cells and into the bloodstream.\nTransport across the Cell Membrane\nOne of the great wonders of the cell membrane is its ability to regulate the concentration of substances inside the\ncell. These substances include ions such as Ca++, Na+, K+, and Cl–; nutrients including sugars, fatty acids, and amino\nacids; and waste products, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), which must leave the cell.\nThe membrane’s lipid bilayer structure provides the first level of control. The phospholipids are tightly packed\ntogether, and the membrane has a hydrophobic interior. This structure causes the membrane to be selectively\npermeable. A membrane that has selective permeability allows only substances meeting certain criteria to pass\nthrough it unaided.', 'In this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the\nprimary chain can be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds.\nA disulfide bond is a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. Often, two or more separate\npolypeptides bond to form an even larger protein with a quaternary structure (see Figure 2.26d). The polypeptide\nsubunits forming a quaternary structure can be identical or different. For instance, hemoglobin, the protein found in\nred blood cells is composed of four tertiary polypeptides, two of which are called alpha chains and two of which are\ncalled beta chains.\nWhen they are exposed to extreme heat, acids, bases, and certain other substances, proteins will denature.\nDenaturation is a change in the structure of a molecule through physical or chemical means. Denatured proteins\nlose their functional shape and are no longer able to carry out their jobs. An everyday example of protein\ndenaturation is the curdling of milk when acidic lemon juice is added.\nThe contribution of the shape of a protein to its function can hardly be exaggerated. For example, the long, slender\nshape of protein strands that make up muscle tissue is essential to their ability to contract (shorten) and relax\n(lengthen). As another example, bones contain long threads of a protein called collagen that acts as scaffolding\n70\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nupon which bone minerals are deposited. These elongated proteins, called fibrous proteins, are strong and durable\nand typically hydrophobic.\nIn contrast, globular proteins are globes or spheres that tend to be highly reactive and are hydrophilic. The\nhemoglobin proteins packed into red blood cells are an example (see Figure 2.26d); however, globular proteins are\nabundant throughout the body, playing critical roles in most body functions. Enzymes, introduced earlier as protein\ncatalysts, are examples of this.

(d) The quaternary structure occurs as a result of interactions between two or more tertiary subunits. The\nexample shown here is hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells which transports oxygen to body tissues.\nAlthough some polypeptides exist as linear chains, most are twisted or folded into more complex secondary\nstructures that form when bonding occurs between amino acids with different properties at different regions of the\npolypeptide. The most common secondary structure is a spiral called an alpha-helix. If you were to take a length of\nstring and simply twist it into a spiral, it would not hold the shape. Similarly, a strand of amino acids could not\nmaintain a stable spiral shape without the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions\nof the same strand (see Figure 2.26b). Less commonly, a polypeptide chain can form a beta-pleated sheet, in which\nhydrogen bonds form bridges between different regions of a single polypeptide that has folded back upon itself, or\nbetween two or more adjacent polypeptide chains.\nThe secondary structure of proteins further folds into a compact three-dimensional shape, referred to as the\nprotein’s tertiary structure (see Figure 2.26c).

(d)\nProducts are released and the enzyme returns to its original form, ready to facilitate another enzymatic reaction.\nBinding of a substrate produces an enzyme–substrate complex.

The cells within a tissue share a\ncommon embryonic origin. Microscopic observation reveals that the cells in a tissue share morphological features\nand are arranged in an orderly pattern that achieves the tissue’s functions. From the evolutionary perspective,\ntissues appear in more complex organisms. For example, multicellular protists, ancient eukaryotes, do not have\ncells organized into tissues.\nAlthough there are many types of cells in the human body, they are organized into four broad categories of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands.', 'The muscle cell, or myocyte, develops from myoblasts derived from the mesoderm. Myocytes and\ntheir numbers remain relatively constant throughout life. Skeletal muscle tissue is arranged in bundles surrounded\nby connective tissue. Under the light microscope, muscle cells appear striated with many nuclei squeezed along the\nmembranes. The striation is due to the regular alternation of the contractile proteins actin and myosin, along with\nthe structural proteins that couple the contractile proteins to connective tissues. The cells are multinucleated as a\nresult of the fusion of the many myoblasts that fuse to form each long muscle fiber.\nCardiac muscle forms the contractile walls of the heart. The cells of cardiac muscle, known as cardiomyocytes, also\nappear striated under the microscope. Unlike skeletal muscle fibers, cardiomyocytes are single cells typically with a\nsingle centrally located nucleus. A principal characteristic of cardiomyocytes is that they contract on their own\nintrinsic rhythms without any external stimulation. Cardiomyocyte attach to one another with specialized cell\njunctions called intercalated discs. Intercalated discs have both anchoring junctions and gap junctions. Attached\ncells form long, branching cardiac muscle fibers that are, essentially, a mechanical and electrochemical syncytium\nallowing the cells to synchronize their actions. The cardiac muscle pumps blood through the body and is under\ninvoluntary control. The attachment junctions hold adjacent cells together across the dynamic pressures changes of\nthe cardiac cycle.\nSmooth muscle tissue contraction is responsible for involuntary movements in the internal organs. It forms the\ncontractile component of the digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems as well as the airways and arteries. Each\ncell is spindle shaped with a single nucleus and no visible striations (Figure 4.18).\n148\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 4.18\nMuscle Tissue\n(a) Skeletal muscle cells have prominent striation and nuclei on their periphery.

(c) Cardiac muscle cells appear striated and have a single nucleus.', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.']","The three main types of muscle tissue are skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle.","skeletal, cardiac, and smooth"
What is the pH range of normal human blood?,"['The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human\nurine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n59\nFIGURE 2.17\nThe pH Scale\nBuffers\nThe pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this\nslightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into\nthe bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids.', 'This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4.

A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids. For example, if there is\neven a slight decrease below 7.35 in the pH of a bodily fluid, the buffer in the fluid—in this case, acting as a weak\nbase—will bind the excess hydrogen ions. In contrast, if pH rises above 7.45, the buffer will act as a weak acid and\ncontribute hydrogen ions.\n60\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nHOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCES\nAcids and Bases\nExcessive acidity of the blood and other body fluids is known as acidosis. Common causes of acidosis are situations\nand disorders that reduce the effectiveness of breathing, especially the person’s ability to exhale fully, which causes\na buildup of CO2 (and H+) in the bloodstream. Acidosis can also be caused by metabolic problems that reduce the\nlevel or function of buffers that act as bases, or that promote the production of acids. For instance, with severe\ndiarrhea, too much bicarbonate can be lost from the body, allowing acids to build up in body fluids. In people with\npoorly managed diabetes (ineffective regulation of blood sugar), acids called ketones are produced as a form of\nbody fuel. These can build up in the blood, causing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Kidney failure,\nliver failure, heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.\nIn contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic). As with\nacidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low.\nLung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the\nnormal concentration of H+.', '(b) In aqueous solution, a base dissociates into hydroxyl ions (OH–) and\ncations. Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–.\nBases\nA base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+ already present in\nsolution (see Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine\nwith H+ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+ and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases\nrelease most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H+. Food\nmixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract\nafter the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3–), a weak base that attracts H+. Bicarbonate\naccepts some of the H+ protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.\nThe Concept of pH\nThe relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution’s pH is the negative, base-10\nlogarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+\nconcentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times\nmore acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH.', 'These\ncompounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain\nboth hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and\ncushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a\nbyproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a\nreactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\nsolution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H+,\nthereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).\nThe pH of any solution is its relative concentration of\nH+. A solution with pH 7 is neutral. Solutions with pH\nbelow 7 are acids, and solutions with pH above 7 are\nbases. A change in a single digit on the pH scale (e.g.,\nfrom 7 to 8) represents a ten-fold increase or decrease\nin the concentration of H+. In a healthy adult, the pH of\nblood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45. Homeostatic control\nmechanisms important for keeping blood in a healthy\npH range include chemicals called buffers, weak acids\nand weak bases released when the pH of blood or\nother body fluids fluctuates in either direction outside\nof this normal range.\n2.5 Organic Compounds Essential to Human\nFunctioning\nOrganic compounds essential to human functioning\ninclude carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and\nnucleotides. These compounds are said to be organic\nbecause they contain both carbon and hydrogen.\nCarbon atoms in organic compounds readily share\nelectrons with hydrogen and other atoms, usually\noxygen, and sometimes nitrogen. Carbon atoms also\nmay bond with one or more functional groups such as\ncarboxyls, hydroxyls, aminos, or phosphates.\nMonomers are single units of organic compounds. They\nbond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which\ncan in turn be broken by hydrolysis.\nCarbohydrate compounds provide essential body fuel.\nTheir structural forms include monosaccharides such\nas glucose, disaccharides such as lactose, and\npolysaccharides, including starches (polymers of\nglucose), glycogen (the storage form of glucose), and\nfiber. All body cells can use glucose for fuel.', 'Immediate treatment is with\npure oxygen. The affected person is then moved into a hyperbaric chamber. A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,\nclosed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body\nso that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to\nthe body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing\nsome of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.\nThe dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the\npressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body\ntissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the\npulsating flow of pressurized blood.\n1.5 Homeostasis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning\n•\nContrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism\nMaintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body\ntemperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point.\nA set point is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set\nof values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is\napproximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to\nfluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point.

Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a).']","The pH range of normal human blood is approximately 7.35 to 7.45, typically identified as pH 7.4.",7.35-7.45

In the posterior\n(dorsal) cavity, the cranial cavity houses the brain, and the spinal cavity (or vertebral cavity) encloses the spinal\ncord. Just as the brain and spinal cord make up a continuous, uninterrupted structure, the cranial and spinal cavities\nthat house them are also continuous. The brain and spinal cord are protected by the bones of the skull and vertebral\ncolumn and by cerebrospinal fluid, a colorless fluid produced by the brain, which cushions the brain and spinal cord\nwithin the posterior (dorsal) cavity.\nThe anterior (ventral) cavity has two main subdivisions: the thoracic cavity and the abdominopelvic cavity (see\nFigure 1.15). The thoracic cavity is the more superior subdivision of the anterior cavity, and it is enclosed by the rib\ncage. The thoracic cavity contains the lungs and the heart, which is located in the mediastinum. The diaphragm\nforms the floor of the thoracic cavity and separates it from the more inferior abdominopelvic cavity. The\nabdominopelvic cavity is the largest cavity in the body. Although no membrane physically divides the\nabdominopelvic cavity, it can be useful to distinguish between the abdominal cavity, the division that houses the\ndigestive organs, and the pelvic cavity, the division that houses the organs of reproduction.', 'A\nplane is an imaginary two-dimensional surface that passes through the body.

The cells within a tissue share a\ncommon embryonic origin. Microscopic observation reveals that the cells in a tissue share morphological features\nand are arranged in an orderly pattern that achieves the tissue’s functions. From the evolutionary perspective,\ntissues appear in more complex organisms. For example, multicellular protists, ancient eukaryotes, do not have\ncells organized into tissues.\nAlthough there are many types of cells in the human body, they are organized into four broad categories of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands.', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.']","The three types of muscle tissue are skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle.","skeletal, cardiac, and smooth"
What is the pH range of normal human blood?,"['The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human\nurine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n59\nFIGURE 2.17\nThe pH Scale\nBuffers\nThe pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this\nslightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into\nthe bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids.', 'This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4.

A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids. For example, if there is\neven a slight decrease below 7.35 in the pH of a bodily fluid, the buffer in the fluid—in this case, acting as a weak\nbase—will bind the excess hydrogen ions. In contrast, if pH rises above 7.45, the buffer will act as a weak acid and\ncontribute hydrogen ions.\n60\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nHOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCES\nAcids and Bases\nExcessive acidity of the blood and other body fluids is known as acidosis. Common causes of acidosis are situations\nand disorders that reduce the effectiveness of breathing, especially the person’s ability to exhale fully, which causes\na buildup of CO2 (and H+) in the bloodstream. Acidosis can also be caused by metabolic problems that reduce the\nlevel or function of buffers that act as bases, or that promote the production of acids. For instance, with severe\ndiarrhea, too much bicarbonate can be lost from the body, allowing acids to build up in body fluids. In people with\npoorly managed diabetes (ineffective regulation of blood sugar), acids called ketones are produced as a form of\nbody fuel. These can build up in the blood, causing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Kidney failure,\nliver failure, heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.\nIn contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic). As with\nacidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low.\nLung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the\nnormal concentration of H+.', '(b) In aqueous solution, a base dissociates into hydroxyl ions (OH–) and\ncations. Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–.\nBases\nA base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+ already present in\nsolution (see Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine\nwith H+ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+ and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases\nrelease most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H+. Food\nmixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract\nafter the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3–), a weak base that attracts H+. Bicarbonate\naccepts some of the H+ protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.\nThe Concept of pH\nThe relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution’s pH is the negative, base-10\nlogarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+\nconcentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times\nmore acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH.', 'These\ncompounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain\nboth hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and\ncushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a\nbyproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a\nreactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\nsolution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H+,\nthereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).\nThe pH of any solution is its relative concentration of\nH+. A solution with pH 7 is neutral. Solutions with pH\nbelow 7 are acids, and solutions with pH above 7 are\nbases. A change in a single digit on the pH scale (e.g.,\nfrom 7 to 8) represents a ten-fold increase or decrease\nin the concentration of H+. In a healthy adult, the pH of\nblood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45. Homeostatic control\nmechanisms important for keeping blood in a healthy\npH range include chemicals called buffers, weak acids\nand weak bases released when the pH of blood or\nother body fluids fluctuates in either direction outside\nof this normal range.\n2.5 Organic Compounds Essential to Human\nFunctioning\nOrganic compounds essential to human functioning\ninclude carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and\nnucleotides. These compounds are said to be organic\nbecause they contain both carbon and hydrogen.\nCarbon atoms in organic compounds readily share\nelectrons with hydrogen and other atoms, usually\noxygen, and sometimes nitrogen. Carbon atoms also\nmay bond with one or more functional groups such as\ncarboxyls, hydroxyls, aminos, or phosphates.\nMonomers are single units of organic compounds. They\nbond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which\ncan in turn be broken by hydrolysis.\nCarbohydrate compounds provide essential body fuel.\nTheir structural forms include monosaccharides such\nas glucose, disaccharides such as lactose, and\npolysaccharides, including starches (polymers of\nglucose), glycogen (the storage form of glucose), and\nfiber. All body cells can use glucose for fuel.', 'Immediate treatment is with\npure oxygen. The affected person is then moved into a hyperbaric chamber. A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,\nclosed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body\nso that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to\nthe body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing\nsome of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.\nThe dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the\npressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body\ntissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the\npulsating flow of pressurized blood.\n1.5 Homeostasis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning\n•\nContrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism\nMaintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body\ntemperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point.\nA set point is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set\nof values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is\napproximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to\nfluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a).']","The pH range of normal human blood is between 7.35 and 7.45, typically identified as pH 7.4.",7.35-7.45

The cells within a tissue share a\ncommon embryonic origin. Microscopic observation reveals that the cells in a tissue share morphological features\nand are arranged in an orderly pattern that achieves the tissue’s functions. From the evolutionary perspective,\ntissues appear in more complex organisms. For example, multicellular protists, ancient eukaryotes, do not have\ncells organized into tissues.\nAlthough there are many types of cells in the human body, they are organized into four broad categories of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands.', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.']","The three types of muscle tissue are skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle.","skeletal, cardiac, and smooth"
What type of radiation does a CT scanner use?,"['(credit a: Akira Ohgaki/flickr; credit b: “Digital Cate”/flickr;\ncredit c: “Raziel”/Wikimedia Commons; credit d: “Isis”/Wikimedia Commons)\nSince 1970, the development of more powerful computers and more sophisticated software has made CT scanning\nroutine for many types of diagnostic evaluations. It is especially useful for soft tissue scanning, such as of the brain\nand the thoracic and abdominal viscera. Its level of detail is so precise that it can allow physicians to measure the\nsize of a mass down to a millimeter. The main disadvantage of CT scanning is that it exposes patients to a dose of\nradiation many times higher than that of X-rays. In fact, children who undergo CT scans are at increased risk of\ndeveloping cancer, as are adults who have multiple CT scans.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nA CT or CAT scan relies on a circling scanner that revolves around the patient’s body. Watch this video\n(http://openstax.org/l/CATscan) to learn more about CT and CAT scans. What type of radiation does a CT scanner\nuse?\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive medical imaging technique based on a phenomenon of nuclear\nphysics discovered in the 1930s, in which matter exposed to magnetic fields and radio waves was found to emit\nradio signals. In 1970, a physician and researcher named Raymond Damadian noticed that malignant (cancerous)\ntissue gave off different signals than normal body tissue. He applied for a patent for the first MRI scanning device,\nwhich was in use clinically by the early 1980s. The early MRI scanners were crude, but advances in digital\ncomputing and electronics led to their advancement over any other technique for precise imaging, especially to\ndiscover tumors. MRI also has the major advantage of not exposing patients to radiation.\nDrawbacks of MRI scans include their much higher cost, and patient discomfort with the procedure. The MRI\nscanner subjects the patient to such powerful electromagnets that the scan room must be shielded.', 'Although often supplanted by more sophisticated imaging techniques, the X-ray remains a “workhorse” in\nmedical imaging, especially for viewing fractures and for dentistry. The disadvantage of irradiation to the patient and\nthe operator is now attenuated by proper shielding and by limiting exposure.\nModern Medical Imaging\nX-rays can depict a two-dimensional image of a body region, and only from a single angle. In contrast, more recent\nmedical imaging technologies produce data that is integrated and analyzed by computers to produce three-\ndimensional images or images that reveal aspects of body functioning.\nComputed Tomography\nTomography refers to imaging by sections. Computed tomography (CT) is a noninvasive imaging technique that\nuses computers to analyze several cross-sectional X-rays in order to reveal minute details about structures in the\nbody (Figure 1.19a). The technique was invented in the 1970s and is based on the principle that, as X-rays pass\nthrough the body, they are absorbed or reflected at different levels. In the technique, a patient lies on a motorized\nplatform while a computerized axial tomography (CAT) scanner rotates 360 degrees around the patient, taking X-ray\nimages. A computer combines these images into a two-dimensional view of the scanned area, or “slice.”\n1.7 • Medical Imaging\n29\nFIGURE 1.19\nMedical Imaging Techniques\n(a) The results of a CT scan of the head are shown as successive transverse sections.

These problems have been overcome somewhat with\nthe development of “open” MRI scanning, which does not require the patient to be entirely enclosed in the metal\ntube. Patients with iron-containing metallic implants (internal sutures, some prosthetic devices, and so on) cannot\nundergo MRI scanning because it can dislodge these implants.\nFunctional MRIs (fMRIs), which detect the concentration of blood flow in certain parts of the body, are increasingly\nbeing used to study the activity in parts of the brain during various body activities.

Although the first PET scanner was introduced in 1961, it took 15 more years before\nradiopharmaceuticals were combined with the technique and revolutionized its potential.', 'In 1895, Röntgen made the first durable record of the internal parts of a living human: an\n“X-ray” image (as it came to be called) of his wife’s hand.

As they are used in medicine, X-rays are emitted from an X-ray machine and directed toward a\nspecially treated metallic plate placed behind the patient’s body. The beam of radiation results in darkening of the\nX-ray plate. X-rays are slightly impeded by soft tissues, which show up as gray on the X-ray plate, whereas hard\ntissues, such as bone, largely block the rays, producing a light-toned “shadow.” Thus, X-rays are best used to\nvisualize hard body structures such as teeth and bones (Figure 1.18). Like many forms of high energy radiation,\nhowever, X-rays are capable of damaging cells and initiating changes that can lead to cancer. This danger of\nexcessive exposure to X-rays was not fully appreciated for many years after their widespread use.\nFIGURE 1.18\nX-Ray of a Hand\nHigh energy electromagnetic radiation allows the internal structures of the body, such as bones, to be\nseen in X-rays like these.

What are the three types of subatomic particles?,"['An electron has about 1/2000th the\nmass of a proton or neutron.\nFigure 2.3 shows two models that can help you imagine the structure of an atom—in this case, helium (He). In the\nplanetary model, helium’s two electrons are shown circling the nucleus in a fixed orbit depicted as a ring. Although\nthis model is helpful in visualizing atomic structure, in reality, electrons do not travel in fixed orbits, but whiz around\nthe nucleus erratically in a so-called electron cloud.\nFIGURE 2.3\nTwo Models of Atomic Structure\n(a) In the planetary model, the electrons of helium are shown in fixed orbits, depicted as\nrings, at a precise distance from the nucleus, somewhat like planets orbiting the sun. (b) In the electron cloud model, the electrons of\nhelium are shown in the variety of locations they would have at different distances from the nucleus over time.\nAn atom’s protons and electrons carry electrical charges.

An atom’s neutrons have no charge: they are electrically\n2.1 • Elements and Atoms: The Building Blocks of Matter\n41\nneutral. Just as a magnet sticks to a steel refrigerator because their opposite charges attract, the positively charged\nprotons attract the negatively charged electrons. This mutual attraction gives the atom some structural stability. The\nattraction by the positively charged nucleus helps keep electrons from straying far. The number of protons and\nelectrons within a neutral atom are equal, thus, the atom’s overall charge is balanced.\nAtomic Number and Mass Number\nAn atom of carbon is unique to carbon, but a proton of carbon is not. One proton is the same as another, whether it is\nfound in an atom of carbon, sodium (Na), or iron (Fe). The same is true for neutrons and electrons. So, what gives an\nelement its distinctive properties—what makes carbon so different from sodium or iron? The answer is the unique\nquantity of protons each contains. Carbon by definition is an element whose atoms contain six protons. No other\nelement has exactly six protons in its atoms. Moreover, all atoms of carbon, whether found in your liver or in a lump\nof coal, contain six protons.', 'The same is true for neutrons and electrons.

Because an atom usually has the same number of electrons as protons, the atomic number\nidentifies the usual number of electrons as well.\nIn their most common form, many elements also contain the same number of neutrons as protons. The most\ncommon form of carbon, for example, has six neutrons as well as six protons, for a total of 12 subatomic particles in\nits nucleus. An element’s mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. So the\nmost common form of carbon’s mass number is 12.

What is the number of electrons in an atom's valence shell that makes it stable?,"['The precise number of shells depends on the number of electrons in the atom. Hydrogen and helium\nhave just one and two electrons, respectively. If you take a look at the periodic table of the elements, you will notice\nthat hydrogen and helium are placed alone on either sides of the top row; they are the only elements that have just\none electron shell (Figure 2.7). A second shell is necessary to hold the electrons in all elements larger than hydrogen\nand helium.\nLithium (Li), whose atomic number is 3, has three electrons. Two of these fill the first electron shell, and the third\nspills over into a second shell. The second electron shell can accommodate as many as eight electrons. Carbon, with\nits six electrons, entirely fills its first shell, and half-fills its second. With ten electrons, neon (Ne) entirely fills its two\nelectron shells. Again, a look at the periodic table reveals that all of the elements in the second row, from lithium to\nneon, have just two electron shells. Atoms with more than ten electrons require more than two shells. These\nelements occupy the third and subsequent rows of the periodic table.\n2.1 • Elements and Atoms: The Building Blocks of Matter\n45\nFIGURE 2.7\nElectron Shells\nElectrons orbit the atomic nucleus at distinct levels of energy called electron shells. (a) With one electron,\nhydrogen only half-fills its electron shell. Helium also has a single shell, but its two electrons completely fill it. (b) The electrons of carbon\ncompletely fill its first electron shell, but only half-fills its second. (c) Neon, an element that does not occur in the body, has 10 electrons,\nfilling both of its electron shells.\nThe factor that most strongly governs the tendency of an atom to participate in chemical reactions is the number of\nelectrons in its valence shell. A valence shell is an atom’s outermost electron shell. If the valence shell is full, the\natom is stable; meaning its electrons are unlikely to be pulled away from the nucleus by the electrical charge of\nother atoms. If the valence shell is not full, the atom is reactive; meaning it will tend to react with other atoms in\nways that make the valence shell full.', 'The factor that most strongly governs the tendency of an atom to participate in chemical reactions is the number of\nelectrons in its valence shell.

This\nsingle electron is likely to be drawn into relationships with the atoms of other elements, so that hydrogen’s single\nvalence shell can be stabilized.\nAll atoms (except hydrogen and helium with their single electron shells) are most stable when there are exactly\neight electrons in their valence shell. This principle is referred to as the octet rule, and it states that an atom will give\nup, gain, or share electrons with another atom so that it ends up with eight electrons in its own valence shell. For\nexample, oxygen, with six electrons in its valence shell, is likely to react with other atoms in a way that results in the\naddition of two electrons to oxygen’s valence shell, bringing the number to eight. When two hydrogen atoms each\nshare their single electron with oxygen, covalent bonds are formed, resulting in a molecule of water, H2O.\nIn nature, atoms of one element tend to join with atoms of other elements in characteristic ways.

Its atomic number is 19. It has just one\nelectron in its valence shell. This characteristic makes potassium highly likely to participate in chemical reactions in\nwhich it donates one electron. (It is easier for potassium to donate one electron than to gain seven electrons.) The\nloss will cause the positive charge of potassium’s protons to be more influential than the negative charge of\npotassium’s electrons. In other words, the resulting potassium ion will be slightly positive. A potassium ion is\nwritten K+, indicating that it has lost a single electron. A positively charged ion is known as a cation.\nNow consider fluorine (F), a component of bones and teeth. Its atomic number is nine, and it has seven electrons in\nits valence shell. Thus, it is highly likely to bond with other atoms in such a way that fluorine accepts one electron (it\nis easier for fluorine to gain one electron than to donate seven electrons). When it does, its electrons will outnumber\nits protons by one, and it will have an overall negative charge. The ionized form of fluorine is called fluoride, and is\nwritten as F–. A negatively charged ion is known as an anion.\n2.2 • Chemical Bonds\n47\nAtoms that have more than one electron to donate or accept will end up with stronger positive or negative charges.\nA cation that has donated two electrons has a net charge of +2. Using magnesium (Mg) as an example, this can be\nwritten Mg++ or Mg2+. An anion that has accepted two electrons has a net charge of –2. The ionic form of selenium\n(Se), for example, is typically written Se2–.\nThe opposite charges of cations and anions exert a moderately strong mutual attraction that keeps the atoms in\nclose proximity forming an ionic bond. An ionic bond is an ongoing, close association between ions of opposite\ncharge. The table salt you sprinkle on your food owes its existence to ionic bonding.', 'One of the most\nadvanced uses of radioisotopes in medicine is the positron emission tomography (PET) scanner, which detects the\nactivity in the body of a very small injection of radioactive glucose, the simple sugar that cells use for energy. The\nPET camera reveals to the medical team which of the patient’s tissues are taking up the most glucose. Thus, the\nmost metabolically active tissues show up as bright “hot spots” on the images (Figure 2.6).

This PET scan shows sites of the spread of a large primary tumor to other sites.\nThe Behavior of Electrons\nIn the human body, atoms do not exist as independent entities. Rather, they are constantly reacting with other\natoms to form and to break down more complex substances. To fully understand anatomy and physiology you must\ngrasp how atoms participate in such reactions. The key is understanding the behavior of electrons.\nAlthough electrons do not follow rigid orbits a set distance away from the atom’s nucleus, they do tend to stay\nwithin certain regions of space called electron shells. An electron shell is a layer of electrons that encircle the\nnucleus at a distinct energy level.\nThe atoms of the elements found in the human body have from one to five electron shells, and all electron shells\nhold eight electrons except the first shell, which can only hold two. This configuration of electron shells is the same\nfor all atoms. The precise number of shells depends on the number of electrons in the atom. Hydrogen and helium\nhave just one and two electrons, respectively. If you take a look at the periodic table of the elements, you will notice\nthat hydrogen and helium are placed alone on either sides of the top row; they are the only elements that have just\none electron shell (Figure 2.7). A second shell is necessary to hold the electrons in all elements larger than hydrogen\nand helium.\nLithium (Li), whose atomic number is 3, has three electrons.', 'A bond is a weak or strong electrical attraction that holds atoms in\nthe same vicinity. The new grouping is typically more stable—less likely to react again—than its component atoms\nwere when they were separate. A more or less stable grouping of two or more atoms held together by chemical\nbonds is called a molecule. The bonded atoms may be of the same element, as in the case of H2, which is called\nmolecular hydrogen or hydrogen gas. When a molecule is made up of two or more atoms of different elements, it is\ncalled a chemical compound. Thus, a unit of water, or H2O, is a compound, as is a single molecule of the gas\nmethane, or CH4.\nThree types of chemical bonds are important in human physiology, because they hold together substances that are\nused by the body for critical aspects of homeostasis, signaling, and energy production, to name just a few important\nprocesses. These are ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds.\nIons and Ionic Bonds\nRecall that an atom typically has the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons.\nAs long as this situation remains, the atom is electrically neutral. But when an atom participates in a chemical\nreaction that results in the donation or acceptance of one or more electrons, the atom will then become positively or\nnegatively charged. This happens frequently for most atoms in order to have a full valence shell, as described\npreviously. This can happen either by gaining electrons to fill a shell that is more than half-full, or by giving away\nelectrons to empty a shell that is less than half-full, thereby leaving the next smaller electron shell as the new, full,\nvalence shell. An atom that has an electrical charge—whether positive or negative—is an ion.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nVisit this website (http://openstax.org/l/electenergy) to learn about electrical energy and the attraction/repulsion of\ncharges.

The cells within a tissue share a\ncommon embryonic origin. Microscopic observation reveals that the cells in a tissue share morphological features\nand are arranged in an orderly pattern that achieves the tissue’s functions. From the evolutionary perspective,\ntissues appear in more complex organisms. For example, multicellular protists, ancient eukaryotes, do not have\ncells organized into tissues.\nAlthough there are many types of cells in the human body, they are organized into four broad categories of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands.', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.']","The three types of muscle tissue are skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle.","skeletal, cardiac, and smooth"
What is the pH range of normal human blood?,"['The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human\nurine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n59\nFIGURE 2.17\nThe pH Scale\nBuffers\nThe pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this\nslightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into\nthe bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids.', 'This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4.

A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids. For example, if there is\neven a slight decrease below 7.35 in the pH of a bodily fluid, the buffer in the fluid—in this case, acting as a weak\nbase—will bind the excess hydrogen ions. In contrast, if pH rises above 7.45, the buffer will act as a weak acid and\ncontribute hydrogen ions.\n60\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nHOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCES\nAcids and Bases\nExcessive acidity of the blood and other body fluids is known as acidosis. Common causes of acidosis are situations\nand disorders that reduce the effectiveness of breathing, especially the person’s ability to exhale fully, which causes\na buildup of CO2 (and H+) in the bloodstream. Acidosis can also be caused by metabolic problems that reduce the\nlevel or function of buffers that act as bases, or that promote the production of acids. For instance, with severe\ndiarrhea, too much bicarbonate can be lost from the body, allowing acids to build up in body fluids. In people with\npoorly managed diabetes (ineffective regulation of blood sugar), acids called ketones are produced as a form of\nbody fuel. These can build up in the blood, causing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Kidney failure,\nliver failure, heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.\nIn contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic). As with\nacidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low.\nLung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the\nnormal concentration of H+.', '(b) In aqueous solution, a base dissociates into hydroxyl ions (OH–) and\ncations. Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–.\nBases\nA base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+ already present in\nsolution (see Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine\nwith H+ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+ and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases\nrelease most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H+. Food\nmixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract\nafter the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3–), a weak base that attracts H+. Bicarbonate\naccepts some of the H+ protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.\nThe Concept of pH\nThe relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution’s pH is the negative, base-10\nlogarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+\nconcentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times\nmore acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH.', 'These\ncompounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain\nboth hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and\ncushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a\nbyproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a\nreactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\nsolution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H+,\nthereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).\nThe pH of any solution is its relative concentration of\nH+. A solution with pH 7 is neutral. Solutions with pH\nbelow 7 are acids, and solutions with pH above 7 are\nbases. A change in a single digit on the pH scale (e.g.,\nfrom 7 to 8) represents a ten-fold increase or decrease\nin the concentration of H+. In a healthy adult, the pH of\nblood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45. Homeostatic control\nmechanisms important for keeping blood in a healthy\npH range include chemicals called buffers, weak acids\nand weak bases released when the pH of blood or\nother body fluids fluctuates in either direction outside\nof this normal range.\n2.5 Organic Compounds Essential to Human\nFunctioning\nOrganic compounds essential to human functioning\ninclude carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and\nnucleotides. These compounds are said to be organic\nbecause they contain both carbon and hydrogen.\nCarbon atoms in organic compounds readily share\nelectrons with hydrogen and other atoms, usually\noxygen, and sometimes nitrogen. Carbon atoms also\nmay bond with one or more functional groups such as\ncarboxyls, hydroxyls, aminos, or phosphates.\nMonomers are single units of organic compounds. They\nbond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which\ncan in turn be broken by hydrolysis.\nCarbohydrate compounds provide essential body fuel.\nTheir structural forms include monosaccharides such\nas glucose, disaccharides such as lactose, and\npolysaccharides, including starches (polymers of\nglucose), glycogen (the storage form of glucose), and\nfiber. All body cells can use glucose for fuel.', 'Immediate treatment is with\npure oxygen. The affected person is then moved into a hyperbaric chamber. A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,\nclosed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body\nso that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to\nthe body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing\nsome of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.\nThe dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the\npressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body\ntissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the\npulsating flow of pressurized blood.\n1.5 Homeostasis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning\n•\nContrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism\nMaintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body\ntemperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point.\nA set point is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set\nof values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is\napproximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to\nfluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a).']","The pH range of normal human blood is between 7.35 and 7.45, typically identified as pH 7.4.",7.35-7.45
What are the three types of catal ysts?,"['Enzymes and Other Catalysts\nFor two chemicals in nature to react with each other they first have to come into contact, and this occurs through\nrandom collisions. Because heat helps increase the kinetic energy of atoms, ions, and molecules, it promotes their\ncollision. But in the body, extremely high heat—such as a very high fever—can damage body cells and be life-\nthreatening. On the other hand, normal body temperature is not high enough to promote the chemical reactions that\nsustain life. That is where catalysts come in.\nIn chemistry, a catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any\nchange. You can think of a catalyst as a chemical change agent. They help increase the rate and force at which\natoms, ions, and molecules collide, thereby increasing the probability that their valence shell electrons will interact.\nThe most important catalysts in the human body are enzymes. An enzyme is a catalyst composed of protein or\nribonucleic acid (RNA), both of which will be discussed later in this chapter. Like all catalysts, enzymes work by\nlowering the level of energy that needs to be invested in a chemical reaction. A chemical reaction’s activation\nenergy is the “threshold” level of energy needed to break the bonds in the reactants. Once those bonds are broken,\nnew arrangements can form. Without an enzyme to act as a catalyst, a much larger investment of energy is needed\nto ignite a chemical reaction (Figure 2.13).\nFIGURE 2.13\nEnzymes\nEnzymes decrease the activation energy required for a given chemical reaction to occur. (a) Without an enzyme,\nthe energy input needed for a reaction to begin is high. (b) With the help of an enzyme, less energy is needed for a reaction to begin.\nEnzymes are critical to the body’s healthy functioning. They assist, for example, with the breakdown of food and its\nconversion to energy. In fact, most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by enzymes.', 'As a general rule, gases tend to react faster than liquids or\nsolids, again because it takes energy to separate particles of a substance, and gases by definition already have\nspace between their particles. Similarly, the larger the molecule, the greater the number of total bonds, so reactions\ninvolving smaller molecules, with fewer total bonds, would be expected to proceed faster.\nIn addition, recall that some elements are more reactive than others. Reactions that involve highly reactive\nelements like hydrogen proceed more quickly than reactions that involve less reactive elements. Reactions involving\nstable elements like helium are not likely to happen at all.\nTemperature\nNearly all chemical reactions occur at a faster rate at higher temperatures. Recall that kinetic energy is the energy of\nmatter in motion. The kinetic energy of subatomic particles increases in response to increases in thermal energy.\nThe higher the temperature, the faster the particles move, and the more likely they are to come in contact and react.\n2.3 • Chemical Reactions\n53\nConcentration and Pressure\nIf just a few people are dancing at a club, they are unlikely to step on each other’s toes. But as more and more\npeople get up to dance—especially if the music is fast—collisions are likely to occur. It is the same with chemical\nreactions: the more particles present within a given space, the more likely those particles are to bump into one\nanother. This means that chemists can speed up chemical reactions not only by increasing the concentration of\nparticles—the number of particles in the space—but also by decreasing the volume of the space, which would\ncorrespondingly increase the pressure. If there were 100 dancers in that club, and the manager abruptly moved the\nparty to a room half the size, the concentration of the dancers would double in the new space, and the likelihood of\ncollisions would increase accordingly.\nEnzymes and Other Catalysts\nFor two chemicals in nature to react with each other they first have to come into contact, and this occurs through\nrandom collisions. Because heat helps increase the kinetic energy of atoms, ions, and molecules, it promotes their\ncollision. But in the body, extremely high heat—such as a very high fever—can damage body cells and be life-\nthreatening. On the other hand, normal body temperature is not high enough to promote the chemical reactions that\nsustain life. That is where catalysts come in.', 'Enzymes, introduced earlier as protein\ncatalysts, are examples of this. The next section takes a closer look at the action of enzymes.\nProteins Function as Enzymes\nIf you were trying to type a paper, and every time you hit a key on your laptop there was a delay of six or seven\nminutes before you got a response, you would probably get a new laptop. In a similar way, without enzymes to\ncatalyze chemical reactions, the human body would be nonfunctional. It functions only because enzymes function.\nEnzymatic reactions—chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes—begin when substrates bind to the enzyme. A\nsubstrate is a reactant in an enzymatic reaction. This occurs on regions of the enzyme known as active sites (Figure\n2.27). Any given enzyme catalyzes just one type of chemical reaction. This characteristic, called specificity, is due to\nthe fact that a substrate with a particular shape and electrical charge can bind only to an active site corresponding\nto that substrate.\nDue to this jigsaw puzzle-like match between an enzyme and its substrates, enzymes are known for their specificity.\nIn fact, as an enzyme binds to its substrate(s), the enzyme structure changes slightly to find the best fit between the\ntransition state (a structural intermediate between the substrate and product) and the active site, just as a rubber\nglove molds to a hand inserted into it. This active-site modification in the presence of substrate, along with the\nsimultaneous formation of the transition state, is called induced fit. Overall, there is a specifically matched enzyme\nfor each substrate and, thus, for each chemical reaction; however, there is some flexibility as well. Some enzymes\nhave the ability to act on several different structurally related substrates.\nFIGURE 2.27\nSteps in an Enzymatic Reaction\nAccording to the induced-fit model, the active site of the enzyme undergoes\nconformational changes upon binding with the substrate.(a) Substrates approach active sites on enzyme.

As in math, chemical equations proceed from left to right, but instead of\nan equal sign, they employ an arrow or arrows indicating the direction in which the chemical reaction proceeds.

Such reactions are referred to as decomposition reactions. A decomposition\nreaction is a chemical reaction that breaks down or “de-composes” something larger into its constituent parts (see\nFigure 2.12b). The general equation for a decomposition reaction is:\n.\nAn exchange reaction is a chemical reaction in which both synthesis and decomposition occur, chemical bonds are\nboth formed and broken, and chemical energy is absorbed, stored, and released (see Figure 2.12c). The simplest\nform of an exchange reaction might be:\n. Notice that, to produce these products, B and C had to\nbreak apart in a decomposition reaction, whereas A and B had to bond in a synthesis reaction. A more complex\nexchange reaction might be:\n.

Still, in the human body, many chemical reactions do proceed in a\npredictable direction, either one way or the other. You can think of this more predictable path as the path of least\nresistance because, typically, the alternate direction requires more energy.\nFactors Influencing the Rate of Chemical Reactions\nIf you pour vinegar into baking soda, the reaction is instantaneous; the concoction will bubble and fizz. But many\nchemical reactions take time. A variety of factors influence the rate of chemical reactions. This section, however, will\nconsider only the most important in human functioning.\nProperties of the Reactants\nIf chemical reactions are to occur quickly, the atoms in the reactants have to have easy access to one another. Thus,\nthe greater the surface area of the reactants, the more readily they will interact. When you pop a cube of cheese into\nyour mouth, you chew it before you swallow it. Among other things, chewing increases the surface area of the food\nso that digestive chemicals can more easily get at it. As a general rule, gases tend to react faster than liquids or\nsolids, again because it takes energy to separate particles of a substance, and gases by definition already have\nspace between their particles.

Enzymes are the most important catalysts in the human body, facilitating chemical reactions essential for life.","catalysts, enzymes, and other catal ysts"
What is the activation energy of a chemical reaction without an enzyme?,"['Enzymes and Other Catalysts\nFor two chemicals in nature to react with each other they first have to come into contact, and this occurs through\nrandom collisions. Because heat helps increase the kinetic energy of atoms, ions, and molecules, it promotes their\ncollision. But in the body, extremely high heat—such as a very high fever—can damage body cells and be life-\nthreatening. On the other hand, normal body temperature is not high enough to promote the chemical reactions that\nsustain life. That is where catalysts come in.\nIn chemistry, a catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any\nchange. You can think of a catalyst as a chemical change agent. They help increase the rate and force at which\natoms, ions, and molecules collide, thereby increasing the probability that their valence shell electrons will interact.\nThe most important catalysts in the human body are enzymes. An enzyme is a catalyst composed of protein or\nribonucleic acid (RNA), both of which will be discussed later in this chapter. Like all catalysts, enzymes work by\nlowering the level of energy that needs to be invested in a chemical reaction. A chemical reaction’s activation\nenergy is the “threshold” level of energy needed to break the bonds in the reactants. Once those bonds are broken,\nnew arrangements can form. Without an enzyme to act as a catalyst, a much larger investment of energy is needed\nto ignite a chemical reaction (Figure 2.13).\nFIGURE 2.13\nEnzymes\nEnzymes decrease the activation energy required for a given chemical reaction to occur. (a) Without an enzyme,\nthe energy input needed for a reaction to begin is high. (b) With the help of an enzyme, less energy is needed for a reaction to begin.\nEnzymes are critical to the body’s healthy functioning. They assist, for example, with the breakdown of food and its\nconversion to energy. In fact, most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by enzymes.', 'As a general rule, gases tend to react faster than liquids or\nsolids, again because it takes energy to separate particles of a substance, and gases by definition already have\nspace between their particles. Similarly, the larger the molecule, the greater the number of total bonds, so reactions\ninvolving smaller molecules, with fewer total bonds, would be expected to proceed faster.\nIn addition, recall that some elements are more reactive than others. Reactions that involve highly reactive\nelements like hydrogen proceed more quickly than reactions that involve less reactive elements. Reactions involving\nstable elements like helium are not likely to happen at all.\nTemperature\nNearly all chemical reactions occur at a faster rate at higher temperatures. Recall that kinetic energy is the energy of\nmatter in motion. The kinetic energy of subatomic particles increases in response to increases in thermal energy.\nThe higher the temperature, the faster the particles move, and the more likely they are to come in contact and react.\n2.3 • Chemical Reactions\n53\nConcentration and Pressure\nIf just a few people are dancing at a club, they are unlikely to step on each other’s toes. But as more and more\npeople get up to dance—especially if the music is fast—collisions are likely to occur. It is the same with chemical\nreactions: the more particles present within a given space, the more likely those particles are to bump into one\nanother. This means that chemists can speed up chemical reactions not only by increasing the concentration of\nparticles—the number of particles in the space—but also by decreasing the volume of the space, which would\ncorrespondingly increase the pressure. If there were 100 dancers in that club, and the manager abruptly moved the\nparty to a room half the size, the concentration of the dancers would double in the new space, and the likelihood of\ncollisions would increase accordingly.\nEnzymes and Other Catalysts\nFor two chemicals in nature to react with each other they first have to come into contact, and this occurs through\nrandom collisions. Because heat helps increase the kinetic energy of atoms, ions, and molecules, it promotes their\ncollision. But in the body, extremely high heat—such as a very high fever—can damage body cells and be life-\nthreatening. On the other hand, normal body temperature is not high enough to promote the chemical reactions that\nsustain life. That is where catalysts come in.', 'Enzymes, introduced earlier as protein\ncatalysts, are examples of this. The next section takes a closer look at the action of enzymes.\nProteins Function as Enzymes\nIf you were trying to type a paper, and every time you hit a key on your laptop there was a delay of six or seven\nminutes before you got a response, you would probably get a new laptop. In a similar way, without enzymes to\ncatalyze chemical reactions, the human body would be nonfunctional. It functions only because enzymes function.\nEnzymatic reactions—chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes—begin when substrates bind to the enzyme. A\nsubstrate is a reactant in an enzymatic reaction. This occurs on regions of the enzyme known as active sites (Figure\n2.27). Any given enzyme catalyzes just one type of chemical reaction. This characteristic, called specificity, is due to\nthe fact that a substrate with a particular shape and electrical charge can bind only to an active site corresponding\nto that substrate.\nDue to this jigsaw puzzle-like match between an enzyme and its substrates, enzymes are known for their specificity.\nIn fact, as an enzyme binds to its substrate(s), the enzyme structure changes slightly to find the best fit between the\ntransition state (a structural intermediate between the substrate and product) and the active site, just as a rubber\nglove molds to a hand inserted into it. This active-site modification in the presence of substrate, along with the\nsimultaneous formation of the transition state, is called induced fit. Overall, there is a specifically matched enzyme\nfor each substrate and, thus, for each chemical reaction; however, there is some flexibility as well. Some enzymes\nhave the ability to act on several different structurally related substrates.\nFIGURE 2.27\nSteps in an Enzymatic Reaction\nAccording to the induced-fit model, the active site of the enzyme undergoes\nconformational changes upon binding with the substrate.(a) Substrates approach active sites on enzyme. (b) Substrates bind to active sites,\nproducing an enzyme–substrate complex. (c) Changes internal to the enzyme–substrate complex facilitate interaction of the substrates. (d)\nProducts are released and the enzyme returns to its original form, ready to facilitate another enzymatic reaction.\nBinding of a substrate produces an enzyme–substrate complex.', 'Water molecules also repel\nmolecules with nonpolar covalent bonds, like fats, lipids, and oils. You can demonstrate this with a simple kitchen\nexperiment: pour a teaspoon of vegetable oil, a compound formed by nonpolar covalent bonds, into a glass of water.\nInstead of instantly dissolving in the water, the oil forms a distinct bead because the polar water molecules repel the\nnonpolar oil.\n2.3 Chemical Reactions\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDistinguish between kinetic and potential energy, and between exergonic and endergonic chemical reactions\n•\nIdentify four forms of energy important in human functioning\n•\nDescribe the three basic types of chemical reactions\n•\nIdentify several factors influencing the rate of chemical reactions\nOne characteristic of a living organism is metabolism, which is the sum total of all of the chemical reactions that go\non to maintain that organism’s health and life. The bonding processes you have learned thus far are anabolic\nchemical reactions; that is, they form larger molecules from smaller molecules or atoms. But recall that metabolism\ncan proceed in another direction: in catabolic chemical reactions, bonds between components of larger molecules\nbreak, releasing smaller molecules or atoms. Both types of reaction involve exchanges not only of matter, but of\nenergy.\nThe Role of Energy in Chemical Reactions\nChemical reactions require a sufficient amount of energy to cause the matter to collide with enough precision and\nforce that old chemical bonds can be broken and new ones formed. In general, kinetic energy is the form of energy\npowering any type of matter in motion. Imagine you are building a brick wall. The energy it takes to lift and place one\nbrick atop another is kinetic energy—the energy matter possesses because of its motion. Once the wall is in place, it\nstores potential energy. Potential energy is the energy of position, or the energy matter possesses because of the\npositioning or structure of its components. If the brick wall collapses, the stored potential energy is released as\nkinetic energy as the bricks fall.\nIn the human body, potential energy is stored in the bonds between atoms and molecules. Chemical energy is the\nform of potential energy in which energy is stored in chemical bonds. When those bonds are formed, chemical\nenergy is invested, and when they break, chemical energy is released.', 'An exchange reaction is a chemical reaction in which both synthesis and decomposition occur, chemical bonds are\nboth formed and broken, and chemical energy is absorbed, stored, and released (see Figure 2.12c). The simplest\nform of an exchange reaction might be:\n. Notice that, to produce these products, B and C had to\nbreak apart in a decomposition reaction, whereas A and B had to bond in a synthesis reaction. A more complex\nexchange reaction might be:\n. Another example might be:\n.\nIn theory, any chemical reaction can proceed in either direction under the right conditions. Reactants may\nsynthesize into a product that is later decomposed.

What are the three types of monosaccharides?,"['As was noted earlier, this reaction\nresults in the release of a molecule of water. Each monomer contributes: One gives up a hydrogen atom and the\nother gives up a hydroxyl group. Polymers are split into monomers by hydrolysis (-lysis = “rupture”).

Grains, fruits, and legumes and other vegetables provide\nmost of the carbohydrate in the human diet, although lactose is found in dairy products.\nAlthough most body cells can break down other organic compounds for fuel, all body cells can use glucose.\nMoreover, nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, spinal cord, and through the peripheral nervous system, as well as red\nblood cells, can use only glucose for fuel. In the breakdown of glucose for energy, molecules of adenosine\ntriphosphate, better known as ATP, are produced. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is composed of a ribose sugar, an\nadenine base, and three phosphate groups. ATP releases free energy when its phosphate bonds are broken, and\nthus supplies ready energy to the cell. More ATP is produced in the presence of oxygen (O2) than in pathways that do\nnot use oxygen. The overall reaction for the conversion of the energy in glucose to energy stored in ATP can be\nwritten:\nIn addition to being a critical fuel source, carbohydrates are present in very small amounts in cells’ structure. For\ninstance, some carbohydrate molecules bind with proteins to produce glycoproteins, and others combine with lipids\nto produce glycolipids, both of which are found in the membrane that encloses the contents of body cells.\nLipids\nA lipid is one of a highly diverse group of compounds made up mostly of hydrocarbons.', 'Monomers are single units of organic compounds. They\nbond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which\ncan in turn be broken by hydrolysis.\nCarbohydrate compounds provide essential body fuel.\nTheir structural forms include monosaccharides such\nas glucose, disaccharides such as lactose, and\npolysaccharides, including starches (polymers of\nglucose), glycogen (the storage form of glucose), and\nfiber. All body cells can use glucose for fuel. It is\nconverted via an oxidation-reduction reaction to ATP.\nLipids are hydrophobic compounds that provide body\nfuel and are important components of many biological\ncompounds. Triglycerides are the most abundant lipid\nin the body, and are composed of a glycerol backbone\nattached to three fatty acid chains. Phospholipids are\ncompounds composed of a diglyceride with a\nphosphate group attached at the molecule’s head. The\nresult is a molecule with polar and nonpolar regions.\nSteroids are lipids formed of four hydrocarbon rings.\nThe most important is cholesterol. Prostaglandins are\nsignaling molecules derived from unsaturated fatty\nacids.\nProteins are critical components of all body tissues.\nThey are made up of monomers called amino acids,\nwhich contain nitrogen, joined by peptide bonds.\nProtein shape is critical to its function. Most body\nproteins are globular. An example is enzymes, which\ncatalyze chemical reactions.\n2 • Chapter Review\n77\nNucleotides are compounds with three building blocks:\none or more phosphate groups, a pentose sugar, and a\nnitrogen-containing base. DNA and RNA are nucleic\nacids that function in protein synthesis. ATP is the\nbody’s fundamental molecule of energy transfer.\nRemoval or addition of phosphates releases or invests\nenergy.\nInteractive Link Questions\n1.

In the periodic table of the\nelements, elements in a single column have the\nsame number of electrons that can participate in a\nchemical reaction.', 'Like lipids, proteins can bind with carbohydrates. They can thereby\nproduce glycoproteins or proteoglycans, both of which have many functions in the body.\nThe body can use proteins for energy when carbohydrate and fat intake is inadequate, and stores of glycogen and\nadipose tissue become depleted. However, since there is no storage site for protein except functional tissues, using\nprotein for energy causes tissue breakdown, and results in body wasting.\nNucleotides\nThe fourth type of organic compound important to human structure and function are the nucleotides (Figure 2.28). A\nnucleotide is one of a class of organic compounds composed of three subunits:\n•\none or more phosphate groups\n•\na pentose sugar: either deoxyribose or ribose\n•\na nitrogen-containing base: adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, or uracil\nNucleotides can be assembled into nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) or the energy compound adenosine triphosphate.\nFIGURE 2.28\nNucleotides\n(a) The building blocks of all nucleotides are one or more phosphate groups, a pentose sugar, and a nitrogen-\ncontaining base.

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is nucleotide that stores\ngenetic information. DNA contains deoxyribose (so-called because it has one less atom of oxygen than ribose) plus\none phosphate group and one nitrogen-containing base. The “choices” of base for DNA are adenine, cytosine,\nguanine, and thymine. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a ribose-containing nucleotide that helps manifest the genetic\ncode as protein.

Like beads in a long\nnecklace, these monomers link by covalent bonds to form long polymers (poly- = “many”). There are many\nexamples of monomers and polymers among the organic compounds.\nMonomers form polymers by engaging in dehydration synthesis (see Figure 2.14). As was noted earlier, this reaction\nresults in the release of a molecule of water. Each monomer contributes: One gives up a hydrogen atom and the\nother gives up a hydroxyl group.

Grains, fruits, and legumes and other vegetables provide\nmost of the carbohydrate in the human diet, although lactose is found in dairy products.\nAlthough most body cells can break down other organic compounds for fuel, all body cells can use glucose.\nMoreover, nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, spinal cord, and through the peripheral nervous system, as well as red\nblood cells, can use only glucose for fuel. In the breakdown of glucose for energy, molecules of adenosine\ntriphosphate, better known as ATP, are produced. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is composed of a ribose sugar, an\nadenine base, and three phosphate groups. ATP releases free energy when its phosphate bonds are broken, and\nthus supplies ready energy to the cell. More ATP is produced in the presence of oxygen (O2) than in pathways that do\nnot use oxygen. The overall reaction for the conversion of the energy in glucose to energy stored in ATP can be\nwritten:\nIn addition to being a critical fuel source, carbohydrates are present in very small amounts in cells’ structure. For\ninstance, some carbohydrate molecules bind with proteins to produce glycoproteins, and others combine with lipids\nto produce glycolipids, both of which are found in the membrane that encloses the contents of body cells.\nLipids\nA lipid is one of a highly diverse group of compounds made up mostly of hydrocarbons.', 'As was noted earlier, this reaction\nresults in the release of a molecule of water.

Disaccharides (di- = “two”) are made up of two monomers.\nPolysaccharides are the polymers, and can consist of hundreds to thousands of monomers.\nMonosaccharides\nA monosaccharide is a monomer of carbohydrates. Five monosaccharides are important in the body. Three of these\nare the hexose sugars, so called because they each contain six atoms of carbon. These are glucose, fructose, and\ngalactose, shown in Figure 2.18a. The remaining monosaccharides are the two pentose sugars, each of which\ncontains five atoms of carbon.

Skeletal muscle tissue is arranged in bundles surrounded\nby connective tissue. Under the light microscope, muscle cells appear striated with many nuclei squeezed along the\nmembranes.

The cells within a tissue share a\ncommon embryonic origin. Microscopic observation reveals that the cells in a tissue share morphological features\nand are arranged in an orderly pattern that achieves the tissue’s functions. From the evolutionary perspective,\ntissues appear in more complex organisms. For example, multicellular protists, ancient eukaryotes, do not have\ncells organized into tissues.\nAlthough there are many types of cells in the human body, they are organized into four broad categories of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands.', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.']","The three types of muscle tissue are skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle.","skeletal, cardiac, and smooth"
What are the nine essential amino acids that cannot be synthesized by the body?,"['Sulfur\ndoes not readily participate in hydrogen bonds, whereas all other amino acids do. This variation influences the way\nthat proteins containing cysteine and methionine are assembled.\nAmino acids join via dehydration synthesis to form protein polymers (Figure 2.25). The unique bond holding amino\nacids together is called a peptide bond. A peptide bond is a covalent bond between two amino acids that forms by\ndehydration synthesis. A peptide, in fact, is a very short chain of amino acids. Strands containing fewer than about\n100 amino acids are generally referred to as polypeptides rather than proteins.\nFIGURE 2.25\nPeptide Bond\nDifferent amino acids join together to form peptides, polypeptides, or proteins via dehydration synthesis.\nThe bonds between the amino acids are peptide bonds R1 and R2 may be the same or different side chains.\nThe body is able to synthesize most of the amino acids from components of other molecules; however, nine cannot\nbe synthesized and have to be consumed in the diet. These are known as the essential amino acids.\nFree amino acids available for protein construction are said to reside in the amino acid pool within cells. Structures\nwithin cells use these amino acids when assembling proteins. If a particular essential amino acid is not available in\nsufficient quantities in the amino acid pool, however, synthesis of proteins containing it can slow or even cease.\nShape of Proteins\nJust as a fork cannot be used to eat soup and a spoon cannot be used to spear meat, a protein’s shape is essential\nto its function. A protein’s shape is determined, most fundamentally, by the sequence of amino acids of which it is\nmade (Figure 2.26a). The sequence is called the primary structure of the protein.\n2.5 • Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n69\nFIGURE 2.26\nThe Shape of Proteins\n(a) The primary structure is the sequence of amino acids that make up the polypeptide chain. (b)\nThe secondary structure, which can take the form of an alpha-helix or a beta-pleated sheet, is maintained by hydrogen bonds between\namino acids in different regions of the original polypeptide strand. (c) The tertiary structure occurs as a result of further folding and bonding\nof the secondary structure.', 'While carbohydrates and lipids are composed of hydrocarbons and oxygen, all\nproteins also contain nitrogen (N), and many contain sulfur (S), in addition to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.\nMicrostructure of Proteins\nProteins are polymers made up of nitrogen-containing monomers called amino acids. An amino acid is a molecule\ncomposed of an amino group and a carboxyl group, together with a variable side chain. Just 20 different amino acids\ncontribute to nearly all of the thousands of different proteins important in human structure and function. Body\nproteins contain a unique combination of a few dozen to a few hundred of these 20 amino acid monomers. All 20 of\nthese amino acids share a similar structure (Figure 2.24). All consist of a central carbon atom to which the following\nare bonded:\n•\na hydrogen atom\n•\nan alkaline (basic) amino group NH2 (see Table 2.1)\n•\nan acidic carboxyl group COOH (see Table 2.1)\n•\na variable group\nFIGURE 2.24\nStructure of an Amino Acid\n68\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNotice that all amino acids contain both an acid (the carboxyl group) and a base (the amino group) (amine =\n“nitrogen-containing”). For this reason, they make excellent buffers, helping the body regulate acid–base balance.\nWhat distinguishes the 20 amino acids from one another is their variable group, which is referred to as a side chain\nor an R-group. This group can vary in size and can be polar or nonpolar, giving each amino acid its unique\ncharacteristics. For example, the side chains of two amino acids—cysteine and methionine—contain sulfur. Sulfur\ndoes not readily participate in hydrogen bonds, whereas all other amino acids do.

Brain damage is likely within five minutes\nwithout oxygen, and death is likely within ten minutes.\n16\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNutrients\nA nutrient is a substance in foods and beverages that is essential to human survival. The three basic classes of\nnutrients are water, the energy-yielding and body-building nutrients, and the micronutrients (vitamins and\nminerals).\nThe most critical nutrient is water. Depending on the environmental temperature and our state of health, we may be\nable to survive for only a few days without water. The body’s functional chemicals are dissolved and transported in\nwater, and the chemical reactions of life take place in water. Moreover, water is the largest component of cells,\nblood, and the fluid between cells, and water makes up about 70 percent of an adult’s body mass. Water also helps\nregulate our internal temperature and cushions, protects, and lubricates joints and many other body structures.\nThe energy-yielding nutrients are primarily carbohydrates and lipids, while proteins mainly supply the amino acids\nthat are the building blocks of the body itself. You ingest these in plant and animal foods and beverages, and the\ndigestive system breaks them down into molecules small enough to be absorbed. The breakdown products of\ncarbohydrates and lipids can then be used in the metabolic processes that convert them to ATP. Although you might\nfeel as if you are starving after missing a single meal, you can survive without consuming the energy-yielding\nnutrients for at least several weeks.\nWater and the energy-yielding nutrients are also referred to as macronutrients because the body needs them in\nlarge amounts. In contrast, micronutrients are vitamins and minerals. These elements and compounds participate in\nmany essential chemical reactions and processes, such as nerve impulses, and some, such as calcium, also\ncontribute to the body’s structure. Your body can store some of the micronutrients in its tissues, and draw on those\nreserves if you fail to consume them in your diet for a few days or weeks. Some others micronutrients, such as\nvitamin C and most of the B vitamins, are water-soluble and cannot be stored, so you need to consume them every\nday or two.', 'In contrast, micronutrients are vitamins and minerals.

Some others micronutrients, such as\nvitamin C and most of the B vitamins, are water-soluble and cannot be stored, so you need to consume them every\nday or two.\nNarrow Range of Temperature\nYou have probably seen news stories about athletes who died of heat stroke, or hikers who died of exposure to cold.\nSuch deaths occur because the chemical reactions upon which the body depends can only take place within a\nnarrow range of body temperature, from just below to just above 37°C (98.6°F). When body temperature rises well\nabove or drops well below normal, certain proteins (enzymes) that facilitate chemical reactions lose their normal\nstructure and their ability to function and the chemical reactions of metabolism cannot proceed.\nThat said, the body can respond effectively to short-term exposure to heat (Figure 1.8) or cold. One of the body’s\nresponses to heat is, of course, sweating. As sweat evaporates from skin, it removes some thermal energy from the\nbody, cooling it. Adequate water (from the extracellular fluid in the body) is necessary to produce sweat, so\nadequate fluid intake is essential to balance that loss during the sweat response. Not surprisingly, the sweat\nresponse is much less effective in a humid environment because the air is already saturated with water. Thus, the\nsweat on the skin’s surface is not able to evaporate, and internal body temperature can get dangerously high.\n1.4 • Requirements for Human Life\n17\nFIGURE 1.8\nExtreme Heat\nHumans acclimate to some degree to repeated exposure to high temperatures. (credit: McKay Savage/flickr)\nThe body can also respond effectively to short-term exposure to cold. One response to cold is shivering, which is\nrandom muscle movement that generates heat. Another response is increased breakdown of stored energy to\ngenerate heat.', 'These\ncompounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain\nboth hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and\ncushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a\nbyproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a\nreactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\nsolution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H+,\nthereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).\nThe pH of any solution is its relative concentration of\nH+. A solution with pH 7 is neutral.

Skeletal muscle tissue is arranged in bundles surrounded\nby connective tissue. Under the light microscope, muscle cells appear striated with many nuclei squeezed along the\nmembranes.

Unlike skeletal muscle fibers, cardiomyocytes are single cells typically with a\nsingle centrally located nucleus. A principal characteristic of cardiomyocytes is that they contract on their own\nintrinsic rhythms without any external stimulation. Cardiomyocyte attach to one another with specialized cell\njunctions called intercalated discs. Intercalated discs have both anchoring junctions and gap junctions. Attached\ncells form long, branching cardiac muscle fibers that are, essentially, a mechanical and electrochemical syncytium\nallowing the cells to synchronize their actions.

The cells within a tissue share a\ncommon embryonic origin. Microscopic observation reveals that the cells in a tissue share morphological features\nand are arranged in an orderly pattern that achieves the tissue’s functions. From the evolutionary perspective,\ntissues appear in more complex organisms. For example, multicellular protists, ancient eukaryotes, do not have\ncells organized into tissues.\nAlthough there are many types of cells in the human body, they are organized into four broad categories of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands.', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.']","The three types of muscle tissue are skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle.","skeletal, cardiac, and smooth"
What is the number of chromosomes in a human diploid cell?,"['While there\nare a few cells in the body that do not undergo cell division (such as gametes, red blood cells, most neurons, and\nsome muscle cells), most somatic cells divide regularly. A somatic cell is a general term for a body cell, and all\nhuman cells, except for the cells that produce eggs and sperm (which are referred to as germ cells), are somatic\ncells. Somatic cells contain two copies of each of their chromosomes (one copy received from each parent). A\nhomologous pair of chromosomes is the two copies of a single chromosome found in each somatic cell. The human\nis a diploid organism, having 23 homologous pairs of chromosomes in each of the somatic cells. The condition of\nhaving pairs of chromosomes is known as diploidy.\nCells in the body replace themselves over the lifetime of a person. For example, the cells lining the gastrointestinal\ntract must be frequently replaced when constantly “worn off” by the movement of food through the gut. But what\ntriggers a cell to divide, and how does it prepare for and complete cell division? The cell cycle is the sequence of\nevents in the life of the cell from the moment it is created at the end of a previous cycle of cell division until it then\ndivides itself, generating two new cells.\n3.5 • Cell Growth and Division\n107\nThe Cell Cycle\nOne “turn” or cycle of the cell cycle consists of two general phases: interphase, followed by mitosis and cytokinesis.\nInterphase is the period of the cell cycle during which the cell is not dividing. The majority of cells are in interphase\nmost of the time. Mitosis is the division of genetic material, during which the cell nucleus breaks down and two new,\nfully functional, nuclei are formed. Cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm into two distinctive cells.\nInterphase\nA cell grows and carries out all normal metabolic functions and processes in a period called G1 (Figure 3.30). G1\nphase (gap 1 phase) is the first gap, or growth phase in the cell cycle. For cells that will divide again, G1 is followed\nby replication of the DNA, during the S phase. The S phase (synthesis phase) is period during which a cell replicates\nits DNA.', 'Therefore, after DNA replication but before cell division, each\ncell actually contains two copies of each chromosome. Each copy of the chromosome is referred to as a sister\nchromatid and is physically bound to the other copy.(Note that the term ""sister chromatid"" is used regardless of the\nsex of the person.) The centromere is the structure that attaches one sister chromatid to another. Because a human\ncell has 46 chromosomes, during this phase, there are 92 chromatids (46 × 2) in the cell. Make sure not to confuse\nthe concept of a pair of chromatids (one chromosome and its exact copy attached during mitosis) and a homologous\npair of chromosomes (two paired chromosomes which were inherited separately, one from each parent) (Figure\n3.31).\n108\n3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 3.31\nA Homologous Pair of Chromosomes with their Attached Sister Chromatids\nThe red and blue colors correspond to a\nhomologous pair of chromosomes. Each member of the pair was separately inherited from one parent. Each chromosome in the\nhomologous pair is also bound to an identical sister chromatid, which is produced by DNA replication, and results in the familiar “X” shape.\nMitosis and Cytokinesis\nThe mitotic phase of the cell typically takes between 1 and 2 hours. During this phase, a cell undergoes two major\nprocesses. First, it completes mitosis, during which the contents of the nucleus are equitably pulled apart and\ndistributed between its two halves. Cytokinesis then occurs, dividing the cytoplasm and cell body into two new cells.\nMitosis is divided into four major stages that take place after interphase (Figure 3.32) and in the following order:\nprophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. The process is then followed by cytokinesis.\nFIGURE 3.32\nCell Division: Mitosis Followed by Cytokinesis\nThe stages of cell division oversee the separation of identical genetic\nmaterial into two new nuclei, followed by the division of the cytoplasm.\n3.5 • Cell Growth and Division\n109\nProphase is the first phase of mitosis, during which the loosely packed chromatin coils and condenses into visible\nchromosomes.', 'The genetic instructions that are used to build and maintain an organism are arranged in an orderly manner in\nstrands of DNA. Within the nucleus are threads of chromatin composed of DNA and associated proteins (Figure\n3.22). Along the chromatin threads, the DNA is wrapped around a set of histone proteins. A nucleosome is a single,\nwrapped DNA-histone complex. Multiple nucleosomes along the entire molecule of DNA appear like a beaded\nnecklace, in which the string is the DNA and the beads are the associated histones. When a cell is in the process of\ndivision, the chromatin condenses into chromosomes, so that the DNA can be safely transported to the “daughter\ncells.” The chromosome is composed of DNA and proteins; it is the condensed form of chromatin. It is estimated\nthat humans have almost 22,000 genes distributed on 46 chromosomes.\nFIGURE 3.22\nDNA Macrostructure\nStrands of DNA are wrapped around supporting histones. These proteins are increasingly bundled\nand condensed into chromatin, which is packed tightly into chromosomes when the cell is ready to divide.\nDNA Replication\nIn order for an organism to grow, develop, and maintain its health, cells must reproduce themselves by dividing to\nproduce two new daughter cells, each with the full complement of DNA as found in the original cell. Billions of new\ncells are produced in an adult human every day. Only very few cell types in the body do not divide, including nerve\ncells, skeletal muscle fibers, and cardiac muscle cells. The division time of different cell types varies. Epithelial cells\nof the skin and gastrointestinal lining, for instance, divide very frequently to replace those that are constantly being\nrubbed off of the surface by friction.\nA DNA molecule is made of two strands that “complement” each other in the sense that the molecules that\ncompose the strands fit together and bind to each other, creating a double-stranded molecule that looks much like a\nlong, twisted ladder. This double helix can be constructed easily because the two strands are antiparallel, meaning\nthe two strands run in opposite directions. Each side rail of the DNA ladder is composed of alternating sugar and\nphosphate groups (Figure 3.23). The two sides of the ladder are not identical, but are complementary.', 'Cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm into two distinctive cells.\nInterphase\nA cell grows and carries out all normal metabolic functions and processes in a period called G1 (Figure 3.30). G1\nphase (gap 1 phase) is the first gap, or growth phase in the cell cycle. For cells that will divide again, G1 is followed\nby replication of the DNA, during the S phase. The S phase (synthesis phase) is period during which a cell replicates\nits DNA.\nFIGURE 3.30\nCell Cycle\nThe two major phases of the cell cycle include mitosis (designated M), when the cell divides, and interphase,\nwhen the cell grows and performs all of its normal functions. Interphase is further subdivided into G1, S, and G2 phases.\nAfter the synthesis phase, the cell proceeds through the G2 phase. The G2 phase is a second gap phase, during\nwhich the cell continues to grow and makes the necessary preparations for mitosis. Between G1, S, and G2 phases,\ncells will vary the most in their duration of the G1 phase. It is here that a cell might spend a couple of hours, or many\ndays. The S phase typically lasts between 8-10 hours and the G2 phase approximately 5 hours. In contrast to these\nphases, the G0 phase is a resting phase of the cell cycle. Cells that have temporarily stopped dividing and are resting\n(a common condition) and cells that have permanently ceased dividing (like nerve cells) are said to be in G0.\nThe Structure of Chromosomes\nBillions of cells in the human body divide every day. During the synthesis phase (S, for DNA synthesis) of interphase,\nthe amount of DNA within the cell precisely doubles. Therefore, after DNA replication but before cell division, each\ncell actually contains two copies of each chromosome. Each copy of the chromosome is referred to as a sister\nchromatid and is physically bound to the other copy.(Note that the term ""sister chromatid"" is used regardless of the\nsex of the person.)

Without nuclei, the life span of RBCs is short, and so the body must produce new\nones constantly.\nFIGURE 3.19\nThe Nucleus\nThe nucleus is the control center of the cell.

What is the pH of blood in a healthy adult?,"['The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human\nurine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n59\nFIGURE 2.17\nThe pH Scale\nBuffers\nThe pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this\nslightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into\nthe bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids.', 'This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4.

A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids. For example, if there is\neven a slight decrease below 7.35 in the pH of a bodily fluid, the buffer in the fluid—in this case, acting as a weak\nbase—will bind the excess hydrogen ions. In contrast, if pH rises above 7.45, the buffer will act as a weak acid and\ncontribute hydrogen ions.\n60\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nHOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCES\nAcids and Bases\nExcessive acidity of the blood and other body fluids is known as acidosis. Common causes of acidosis are situations\nand disorders that reduce the effectiveness of breathing, especially the person’s ability to exhale fully, which causes\na buildup of CO2 (and H+) in the bloodstream. Acidosis can also be caused by metabolic problems that reduce the\nlevel or function of buffers that act as bases, or that promote the production of acids. For instance, with severe\ndiarrhea, too much bicarbonate can be lost from the body, allowing acids to build up in body fluids. In people with\npoorly managed diabetes (ineffective regulation of blood sugar), acids called ketones are produced as a form of\nbody fuel. These can build up in the blood, causing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Kidney failure,\nliver failure, heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.\nIn contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic). As with\nacidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low.\nLung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the\nnormal concentration of H+.', '(b) In aqueous solution, a base dissociates into hydroxyl ions (OH–) and\ncations. Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–.\nBases\nA base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+ already present in\nsolution (see Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine\nwith H+ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+ and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases\nrelease most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H+. Food\nmixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract\nafter the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3–), a weak base that attracts H+. Bicarbonate\naccepts some of the H+ protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.\nThe Concept of pH\nThe relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution’s pH is the negative, base-10\nlogarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+\nconcentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times\nmore acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH.', 'These\ncompounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain\nboth hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and\ncushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a\nbyproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a\nreactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\nsolution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H+,\nthereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).\nThe pH of any solution is its relative concentration of\nH+. A solution with pH 7 is neutral. Solutions with pH\nbelow 7 are acids, and solutions with pH above 7 are\nbases. A change in a single digit on the pH scale (e.g.,\nfrom 7 to 8) represents a ten-fold increase or decrease\nin the concentration of H+. In a healthy adult, the pH of\nblood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45. Homeostatic control\nmechanisms important for keeping blood in a healthy\npH range include chemicals called buffers, weak acids\nand weak bases released when the pH of blood or\nother body fluids fluctuates in either direction outside\nof this normal range.\n2.5 Organic Compounds Essential to Human\nFunctioning\nOrganic compounds essential to human functioning\ninclude carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and\nnucleotides. These compounds are said to be organic\nbecause they contain both carbon and hydrogen.\nCarbon atoms in organic compounds readily share\nelectrons with hydrogen and other atoms, usually\noxygen, and sometimes nitrogen. Carbon atoms also\nmay bond with one or more functional groups such as\ncarboxyls, hydroxyls, aminos, or phosphates.\nMonomers are single units of organic compounds. They\nbond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which\ncan in turn be broken by hydrolysis.\nCarbohydrate compounds provide essential body fuel.\nTheir structural forms include monosaccharides such\nas glucose, disaccharides such as lactose, and\npolysaccharides, including starches (polymers of\nglucose), glycogen (the storage form of glucose), and\nfiber. All body cells can use glucose for fuel.', 'Immediate treatment is with\npure oxygen. The affected person is then moved into a hyperbaric chamber. A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,\nclosed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body\nso that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to\nthe body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing\nsome of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.\nThe dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the\npressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body\ntissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the\npulsating flow of pressurized blood.\n1.5 Homeostasis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning\n•\nContrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism\nMaintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body\ntemperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point.\nA set point is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set\nof values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is\napproximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to\nfluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a).']","The pH of blood in a healthy adult typically ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, with an average of approximately 7.4.",7.35 to 7.45

Three disaccharides (shown in Figure 2.19) are\nimportant to humans. These are sucrose, commonly referred to as table sugar; lactose, or milk sugar; and maltose,\nor malt sugar. As you can tell from their common names, you consume these in your diet; however, your body cannot\nuse them directly. Instead, in the digestive tract, they are split into their component monosaccharides via hydrolysis.\n2.5 • Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n63\nFIGURE 2.19\nThree Important Disaccharides\nAll three important disaccharides form by dehydration synthesis.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/disaccharide) to observe the formation of a disaccharide. What happens\nwhen water encounters a glycosidic bond?\nPolysaccharides\nPolysaccharides can contain a few to a thousand or more monosaccharides. Three are important to the body (Figure\n2.20):\n•\nStarches are polymers of glucose. They occur in long chains called amylose or branched chains called\namylopectin, both of which are stored in plant-based foods and are relatively easy to digest.\n64\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n•\nGlycogen is also a polymer of glucose, but it is stored in the tissues of animals, especially in the muscles and\nliver. It is not considered a dietary carbohydrate because very little glycogen remains in animal tissues after\nslaughter; however, the human body stores excess glucose as glycogen, again, in the muscles and liver.\n•\nCellulose, a polysaccharide that is the primary component of the cell wall of green plants, is the component of\nplant food referred to as “fiber”.', 'As was noted earlier, this reaction\nresults in the release of a molecule of water. Each monomer contributes: One gives up a hydrogen atom and the\nother gives up a hydroxyl group. Polymers are split into monomers by hydrolysis (-lysis = “rupture”). The bonds\nbetween their monomers are broken, via the donation of a molecule of water, which contributes a hydrogen atom to\none monomer and a hydroxyl group to the other.\nCarbohydrates\nThe term carbohydrate means “hydrated carbon.” Recall that the root hydro- indicates water. A carbohydrate is a\nmolecule composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; in most carbohydrates, hydrogen and oxygen are found in the\nsame two-to-one relative proportions they have in water. In fact, the chemical formula for a “generic” molecule of\ncarbohydrate is (CH2O)n.\nCarbohydrates are referred to as saccharides, a word meaning “sugars.” Three forms are important in the body.\nMonosaccharides are the monomers of carbohydrates. Disaccharides (di- = “two”) are made up of two monomers.\nPolysaccharides are the polymers, and can consist of hundreds to thousands of monomers.\nMonosaccharides\nA monosaccharide is a monomer of carbohydrates. Five monosaccharides are important in the body. Three of these\nare the hexose sugars, so called because they each contain six atoms of carbon. These are glucose, fructose, and\ngalactose, shown in Figure 2.18a. The remaining monosaccharides are the two pentose sugars, each of which\ncontains five atoms of carbon. They are ribose and deoxyribose, shown in Figure 2.18b.\n62\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 2.18\nFive Important Monosaccharides\nDisaccharides\nA disaccharide is a pair of monosaccharides.

In humans, cellulose/fiber is not digestible; however, dietary fiber has many\nhealth benefits. It helps you feel full so you eat less, it promotes a healthy digestive tract, and a diet high in fiber\nis thought to reduce the risk of heart disease and possibly some forms of cancer.\nFIGURE 2.20\nThree Important Polysaccharides\nThree important polysaccharides are starches, glycogen, and fiber.\nFunctions of Carbohydrates\nThe body obtains carbohydrates from plant-based foods. Grains, fruits, and legumes and other vegetables provide\nmost of the carbohydrate in the human diet, although lactose is found in dairy products.\nAlthough most body cells can break down other organic compounds for fuel, all body cells can use glucose.\nMoreover, nerve cells (neurons) in the brain, spinal cord, and through the peripheral nervous system, as well as red\nblood cells, can use only glucose for fuel. In the breakdown of glucose for energy, molecules of adenosine\ntriphosphate, better known as ATP, are produced. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is composed of a ribose sugar, an\nadenine base, and three phosphate groups. ATP releases free energy when its phosphate bonds are broken, and\nthus supplies ready energy to the cell. More ATP is produced in the presence of oxygen (O2) than in pathways that do\nnot use oxygen. The overall reaction for the conversion of the energy in glucose to energy stored in ATP can be\nwritten:\nIn addition to being a critical fuel source, carbohydrates are present in very small amounts in cells’ structure. For\ninstance, some carbohydrate molecules bind with proteins to produce glycoproteins, and others combine with lipids\nto produce glycolipids, both of which are found in the membrane that encloses the contents of body cells.\nLipids\nA lipid is one of a highly diverse group of compounds made up mostly of hydrocarbons.', 'The overall reaction for the conversion of the energy in glucose to energy stored in ATP can be\nwritten:\nIn addition to being a critical fuel source, carbohydrates are present in very small amounts in cells’ structure.

The few oxygen atoms they\ncontain are often at the periphery of the molecule. Their nonpolar hydrocarbons make all lipids hydrophobic. In\nwater, lipids do not form a true solution, but they may form an emulsion, which is the term for a mixture of solutions\nthat do not mix well.\nTriglycerides\nA triglyceride is one of the most common dietary lipid groups, and the type found most abundantly in body tissues.\nThis compound, which is commonly referred to as a fat, is formed from the synthesis of two types of molecules\n(Figure 2.21):\n•\nA glycerol backbone at the core of triglycerides, consists of three carbon atoms.\n•\nThree fatty acids, long chains of hydrocarbons with a carboxyl group and a methyl group at opposite ends,\nextend from each of the carbons of the glycerol.\n2.5 • Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n65\nFIGURE 2.21\nTriglycerides\nTriglycerides are composed of glycerol attached to three fatty acids via dehydration synthesis. Notice that\nglycerol gives up a hydrogen atom, and the carboxyl groups on the fatty acids each give up a hydroxyl group.\nTriglycerides form via dehydration synthesis. Glycerol gives up hydrogen atoms from its hydroxyl groups at each\nbond, and the carboxyl group on each fatty acid chain gives up a hydroxyl group. A total of three water molecules are\nthereby released.\nFatty acid chains that have no double carbon bonds anywhere along their length and therefore contain the maximum\nnumber of hydrogen atoms are called saturated fatty acids. These straight, rigid chains pack tightly together and are\nsolid or semi-solid at room temperature (Figure 2.22a).', 'Monomers are single units of organic compounds. They\nbond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which\ncan in turn be broken by hydrolysis.\nCarbohydrate compounds provide essential body fuel.\nTheir structural forms include monosaccharides such\nas glucose, disaccharides such as lactose, and\npolysaccharides, including starches (polymers of\nglucose), glycogen (the storage form of glucose), and\nfiber. All body cells can use glucose for fuel. It is\nconverted via an oxidation-reduction reaction to ATP.\nLipids are hydrophobic compounds that provide body\nfuel and are important components of many biological\ncompounds. Triglycerides are the most abundant lipid\nin the body, and are composed of a glycerol backbone\nattached to three fatty acid chains. Phospholipids are\ncompounds composed of a diglyceride with a\nphosphate group attached at the molecule’s head. The\nresult is a molecule with polar and nonpolar regions.\nSteroids are lipids formed of four hydrocarbon rings.\nThe most important is cholesterol. Prostaglandins are\nsignaling molecules derived from unsaturated fatty\nacids.\nProteins are critical components of all body tissues.\nThey are made up of monomers called amino acids,\nwhich contain nitrogen, joined by peptide bonds.\nProtein shape is critical to its function. Most body\nproteins are globular. An example is enzymes, which\ncatalyze chemical reactions.\n2 • Chapter Review\n77\nNucleotides are compounds with three building blocks:\none or more phosphate groups, a pentose sugar, and a\nnitrogen-containing base.

What is the pH of...,"['The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human\nurine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n59\nFIGURE 2.17\nThe pH Scale\nBuffers\nThe pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this\nslightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into\nthe bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids.', '(b) In aqueous solution, a base dissociates into hydroxyl ions (OH–) and\ncations. Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–.\nBases\nA base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+ already present in\nsolution (see Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine\nwith H+ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+ and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases\nrelease most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H+. Food\nmixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract\nafter the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3–), a weak base that attracts H+. Bicarbonate\naccepts some of the H+ protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.\nThe Concept of pH\nThe relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution’s pH is the negative, base-10\nlogarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+\nconcentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times\nmore acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+.

A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids. For example, if there is\neven a slight decrease below 7.35 in the pH of a bodily fluid, the buffer in the fluid—in this case, acting as a weak\nbase—will bind the excess hydrogen ions. In contrast, if pH rises above 7.45, the buffer will act as a weak acid and\ncontribute hydrogen ions.\n60\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nHOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCES\nAcids and Bases\nExcessive acidity of the blood and other body fluids is known as acidosis. Common causes of acidosis are situations\nand disorders that reduce the effectiveness of breathing, especially the person’s ability to exhale fully, which causes\na buildup of CO2 (and H+) in the bloodstream. Acidosis can also be caused by metabolic problems that reduce the\nlevel or function of buffers that act as bases, or that promote the production of acids. For instance, with severe\ndiarrhea, too much bicarbonate can be lost from the body, allowing acids to build up in body fluids. In people with\npoorly managed diabetes (ineffective regulation of blood sugar), acids called ketones are produced as a form of\nbody fuel. These can build up in the blood, causing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Kidney failure,\nliver failure, heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.\nIn contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic). As with\nacidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low.\nLung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the\nnormal concentration of H+.', 'Many other salts are important in the body. For example, bile salts produced by the liver help break apart dietary\nfats, and calcium phosphate salts form the mineral portion of teeth and bones.\nAcids and Bases\nAcids and bases, like salts, dissociate in water into electrolytes. Acids and bases can very much change the\nproperties of the solutions in which they are dissolved.\nAcids\nAn acid is a substance that releases hydrogen ions (H+) in solution (Figure 2.16a). Because an atom of hydrogen has\njust one proton and one electron, a positively charged hydrogen ion is simply a proton. This solitary proton is highly\nlikely to participate in chemical reactions. Strong acids are compounds that release all of their H+ in solution; that is,\nthey ionize completely. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is released from cells in the lining of the stomach, is a strong\nacid because it releases all of its H+ in the stomach’s watery environment. This strong acid aids in digestion and kills\ningested microbes. Weak acids do not ionize completely; that is, some of their hydrogen ions remain bonded within a\ncompound in solution. An example of a weak acid is vinegar, or acetic acid; it is called acetate after it gives up a\nproton.\n58\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 2.16\nAcids and Bases\n(a) In aqueous solution, an acid dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+) and anions.
