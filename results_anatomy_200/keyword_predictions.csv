Where is the nucleus located within a cell?,"['Transitional describes a form of specialized\nstratified epithelium in which the shape of the cells can vary.\nFIGURE 4.6\nCells of Epithelial Tissue\nSimple epithelial tissue is organized as a single layer of cells and stratified epithelial tissue is\nformed by several layers of cells.\nSimple Epithelium\nThe shape of the cells in the single cell layer of simple epithelium reflects the functioning of those cells. The cells in\nsimple squamous epithelium have the appearance of thin scales. Squamous cell nuclei tend to be flat, horizontal,\nand elliptical, mirroring the form of the cell. The endothelium is the epithelial tissue that lines vessels of the\nlymphatic and cardiovascular system, and it is made up of a single layer of squamous cells. Simple squamous\nepithelium, because of the thinness of the cell, is present where rapid passage of chemical compounds is observed.\nThe alveoli of lungs where gases diffuse, segments of kidney tubules, and the lining of capillaries are also made of\nsimple squamous epithelial tissue. The mesothelium is a simple squamous epithelium that forms the surface layer\nof the serous membrane that lines body cavities and internal organs. Its primary function is to provide a smooth and\nprotective surface. Mesothelial cells are squamous epithelial cells that secrete a fluid that lubricates the\nmesothelium.\nIn simple cuboidal epithelium, the nucleus of the box-like cells appears round and is generally located near the\ncenter of the cell. These epithelia are active in the secretion and absorptions of molecules. Simple cuboidal epithelia\n4.2 • Epithelial Tissue\n133\nare observed in the lining of the kidney tubules and in the ducts of glands.\nIn simple columnar epithelium, the nucleus of the tall column-like cells tends to be elongated and located in the\nbasal end of the cells. Like the cuboidal epithelia, this epithelium is active in the absorption and secretion of\nmolecules. Simple columnar epithelium forms the lining of some sections of the digestive system and parts of the\nfemale reproductive tract. Ciliated columnar epithelium is composed of simple columnar epithelial cells with cilia on\ntheir apical surfaces.', 'The\nendoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and\nlysosomes share a functional connectivity and are\ncollectively referred to as the endomembrane system.\nThere are two types of ER: smooth and rough. While\nthe smooth ER performs many functions, including lipid\nsynthesis and ion storage, the rough ER is mainly\nresponsible for protein synthesis using its associated\nribosomes. The rough ER sends newly made proteins\nto the Golgi apparatus where they are modified and\npackaged for delivery to various locations within or\noutside of the cell. Some of these protein products are\nenzymes destined to break down unwanted material\nand are packaged as lysosomes for use inside the cell.\nCells also contain mitochondria and peroxisomes,\nwhich are the organelles responsible for producing the\ncell’s energy supply and detoxifying certain chemicals,\nrespectively. Biochemical reactions within\nmitochondria transform energy-carrying molecules into\nthe usable form of cellular energy known as ATP.\nPeroxisomes contain enzymes that transform harmful\nsubstances such as free radicals into oxygen and water.\nCells also contain a miniaturized “skeleton” of protein\nfilaments that extend throughout its interior. Three\ndifferent kinds of filaments compose this cytoskeleton\n(in order of increasing thickness): microfilaments,\nintermediate filaments, and microtubules. Each\ncytoskeletal component performs unique functions as\nwell as provides a supportive framework for the cell.\n3.3 The Nucleus and DNA Replication\nThe nucleus is the command center of the cell,\ncontaining the genetic instructions for all of the\nmaterials a cell will make (and thus all of its functions it\ncan perform). The nucleus is encased within a\nmembrane of two interconnected lipid bilayers, side-\nby-side. This nuclear envelope is studded with protein-\nlined pores that allow materials to be trafficked into\nand out of the nucleus. The nucleus contains one or\nmore nucleoli, which serve as sites for ribosome\nsynthesis. The nucleus houses the genetic material of\nthe cell: DNA. DNA is normally found as a loosely\ncontained structure called chromatin within the\nnucleus, where it is wound up and associated with a\nvariety of histone proteins. When a cell is about to\ndivide, the chromatin coils tightly and condenses to\nform chromosomes.', 'Choose the term that best completes the following\nanalogy: Cytoplasm is to cytosol as a swimming\npool containing chlorine and flotation toys is to\n__.\na.\nthe walls of the pool\nb.\nthe chlorine\nc.\nthe flotation toys\nd.\nthe water\n11.

Simple columnar epithelium forms the lining of some sections of the digestive system and parts of the\nfemale reproductive tract. Ciliated columnar epithelium is composed of simple columnar epithelial cells with cilia on\ntheir apical surfaces. These epithelial cells are found in the lining of the fallopian tubes and parts of the respiratory\nsystem, where the beating of the cilia helps remove particulate matter.\nPseudostratified columnar epithelium is a type of epithelium that appears to be stratified but instead consists of a\nsingle layer of irregularly shaped and differently sized columnar cells. In pseudostratified epithelium, nuclei of\nneighboring cells appear at different levels rather than clustered in the basal end. The arrangement gives the\nappearance of stratification; but in fact all the cells are in contact with the basal lamina, although some do not reach\nthe apical surface. Pseudostratified columnar epithelium is found in the respiratory tract, where some of these cells\nhave cilia.\nBoth simple and pseudostratified columnar epithelia are heterogeneous epithelia because they include additional\ntypes of cells interspersed among the epithelial cells.

Some of these structures are very small and can\nonly be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a microscope. Other larger structures can readily be seen,\nmanipulated, measured, and weighed. The word “anatomy” comes from a Greek root that means “to cut apart.”\nHuman anatomy was first studied by observing the exterior of the body and observing the wounds of soldiers and\nother injuries. Later, physicians were allowed to dissect bodies of the dead to augment their knowledge. When a\nbody is dissected, its structures are cut apart in order to observe their physical attributes and their relationships to\none another. Dissection is still used in medical schools, anatomy courses, and in pathology labs. In order to observe\nstructures in living people, however, a number of imaging techniques have been developed. These techniques allow\nclinicians to visualize structures inside the living body such as a cancerous tumor or a fractured bone.\nLike most scientific disciplines, anatomy has areas of specialization. Gross anatomy is the study of the larger\nstructures of the body, those visible without the aid of magnification (Figure 1.2 a). Macro- means “large,” thus,\ngross anatomy is also referred to as macroscopic anatomy. In contrast, micro- means “small,” and microscopic\nanatomy is the study of structures that can be observed only with the use of a microscope or other magnification\ndevices (Figure 1.2 b).', 'For example, a systemic anatomical study of the muscular system\nwould consider all of the skeletal muscles of the body.\nWhereas anatomy is about structure, physiology is about function. Human physiology is the scientific study of the\nchemistry and physics of the structures of the body and the ways in which they work together to support the\nfunctions of life. Much of the study of physiology centers on the body’s tendency toward homeostasis. Homeostasis\nis the state of steady internal conditions maintained by living things. The study of physiology certainly includes\nobservation, both with the naked eye and with microscopes, as well as manipulations and measurements. However,\ncurrent advances in physiology usually depend on carefully designed laboratory experiments that reveal the\n8\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nfunctions of the many structures and chemical compounds that make up the human body.\nLike anatomists, physiologists typically specialize in a particular branch of physiology. For example, neurophysiology\nis the study of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves and how these work together to perform functions as complex and\ndiverse as vision, movement, and thinking. Physiologists may work from the organ level (exploring, for example,\nwhat different parts of the brain do) to the molecular level (such as exploring how an electrochemical signal travels\nalong nerves).\nForm is closely related to function in all living things. For example, the thin flap of your eyelid can snap down to clear\naway dust particles and almost instantaneously slide back up to allow you to see again. At the microscopic level, the\narrangement and function of the nerves and muscles that serve the eyelid allow for its quick action and retreat. At a\nsmaller level of analysis, the function of these nerves and muscles likewise relies on the interactions of specific\nmolecules and ions. Even the three-dimensional structure of certain molecules is essential to their function.\nYour study of anatomy and physiology will make more sense if you continually relate the form of the structures you\nare studying to their function. In fact, it can be somewhat frustrating to attempt to study anatomy without an\nunderstanding of the physiology that a body structure supports. Imagine, for example, trying to appreciate the\nunique arrangement of the bones of the human hand if you had no conception of the function of the hand.', 'Like most scientific disciplines, anatomy has areas of specialization. Gross anatomy is the study of the larger\nstructures of the body, those visible without the aid of magnification (Figure 1.2 a).

In contrast, micro- means “small,” and microscopic\nanatomy is the study of structures that can be observed only with the use of a microscope or other magnification\ndevices (Figure 1.2 b). Microscopic anatomy includes cytology, the study of cells and histology, the study of tissues.\nAs the technology of microscopes has advanced, anatomists have been able to observe smaller and smaller\nstructures of the body, from slices of large structures like the heart, to the three-dimensional structures of large\nmolecules in the body.\nFIGURE 1.2\nGross and Microscopic Anatomy\n(a) Gross anatomy considers large structures such as the brain.

(credit a:\n“WriterHound”/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)\nAnatomists take two general approaches to the study of the body’s structures: regional and systemic. Regional\nanatomy is the study of the interrelationships of all of the structures in a specific body region, such as the abdomen.\nStudying regional anatomy helps us appreciate the interrelationships of body structures, such as how muscles,\nnerves, blood vessels, and other structures work together to serve a particular body region. In contrast, systemic\nanatomy is the study of the structures that make up a discrete body system—that is, a group of structures that work\ntogether to perform a unique body function. For example, a systemic anatomical study of the muscular system\nwould consider all of the skeletal muscles of the body.\nWhereas anatomy is about structure, physiology is about function.

As each step of clotting occurs,\n22\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nit stimulates the release of more clotting substances. This accelerates the processes of clotting and sealing off the\ndamaged area. Clotting is contained in a local area based on the tightly controlled availability of clotting proteins.\nThis is an adaptive, life-saving cascade of events.\n1.6 Anatomical Terminology\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDemonstrate the anatomical position\n•\nDescribe the human body using directional and regional terms\n•\nIdentify three planes most commonly used in the study of anatomy\n•\nDistinguish between the posterior (dorsal) and the anterior (ventral) body cavities, identifying their subdivisions\nand representative organs found in each\n•\nDescribe serous membrane and explain its function\nAnatomists and health care providers use terminology that can be bewildering to the uninitiated. However, the\npurpose of this language is not to confuse, but rather to increase precision and reduce medical errors. For example,\nis a scar “above the wrist” located on the forearm two or three inches away from the hand? Or is it at the base of the\nhand? Is it on the palm-side or back-side? By using precise anatomical terminology, we eliminate ambiguity.\nAnatomical terms derive from ancient Greek and Latin words. Because these languages are no longer used in\neveryday conversation, the meaning of their words does not change.\nAnatomical terms are made up of roots, prefixes, and suffixes. The root of a term often refers to an organ, tissue, or\ncondition, whereas the prefix or suffix often describes the root. For example, in the disorder hypertension, the prefix\n“hyper-” means “high” or “over,” and the root word “tension” refers to pressure, so the word “hypertension” refers\nto abnormally high blood pressure.\nAnatomical Position\nTo further increase precision, anatomists standardize the way in which they view the body.', 'Pedagogical Foundation and Features\nAnatomy and Physiology 2e is designed to promote\nscientific literacy.

For\nexample, hair on the head protects the skull from the sun. The hair in the nose and ears, and around the eyes\n(eyelashes) defends the body by trapping and excluding dust particles that may contain allergens and microbes.\nHair of the eyebrows prevents sweat and other particles from dripping into and bothering the eyes. Hair also has a\nsensory function due to sensory innervation by a hair root plexus surrounding the base of each hair follicle. Hair is\nextremely sensitive to air movement or other disturbances in the environment, much more so than the skin surface.\nThis feature is also useful for the detection of the presence of insects or other potentially damaging substances on\nthe skin surface. Each hair root is connected to a smooth muscle called the arrector pili that contracts in response\nto nerve signals from the sympathetic nervous system, making the external hair shaft “stand up.” The primary\npurpose for this is to trap a layer of air to add insulation. This is visible in humans as goose bumps and even more\nobvious in animals, such as when a frightened cat raises its fur. Of course, this is much more obvious in organisms\nwith a heavier coat than most humans, such as dogs and cats.\nHair Growth\nHair grows and is eventually shed and replaced by new hair. This occurs in three phases. The first is the anagen\nphase, during which cells divide rapidly at the root of the hair, pushing the hair shaft up and out. The length of this\nphase is measured in years, typically from 2 to 7 years. The catagen phase lasts only 2 to 3 weeks, and marks a\ntransition from the hair follicle’s active growth. Finally, during the telogen phase, the hair follicle is at rest and no\nnew growth occurs. At the end of this phase, which lasts about 2 to 4 months, another anagen phase begins. The\nbasal cells in the hair matrix then produce a new hair follicle, which pushes the old hair out as the growth cycle\nrepeats itself. Hair typically grows at the rate of 0.3 mm per day during the anagen phase. On average, 50 hairs are\nlost and replaced per day.']","The preface in a medical textbook serves to acknowledge contributors, outline the book's objectives, and explain its structure and features, helping readers understand how to navigate the content effectively.

Like the cuboidal epithelia, this epithelium is active in the absorption and secretion of\nmolecules. Simple columnar epithelium forms the lining of some sections of the digestive system and parts of the\nfemale reproductive tract. Ciliated columnar epithelium is composed of simple columnar epithelial cells with cilia on\ntheir apical surfaces. These epithelial cells are found in the lining of the fallopian tubes and parts of the respiratory\nsystem, where the beating of the cilia helps remove particulate matter.\nPseudostratified columnar epithelium is a type of epithelium that appears to be stratified but instead consists of a\nsingle layer of irregularly shaped and differently sized columnar cells. In pseudostratified epithelium, nuclei of\nneighboring cells appear at different levels rather than clustered in the basal end. The arrangement gives the\nappearance of stratification; but in fact all the cells are in contact with the basal lamina, although some do not reach\nthe apical surface. Pseudostratified columnar epithelium is found in the respiratory tract, where some of these cells\nhave cilia.\nBoth simple and pseudostratified columnar epithelia are heterogeneous epithelia because they include additional\ntypes of cells interspersed among the epithelial cells.

What is the narrow range of body temperature within which the body's chemical reactions can take place?,"['In contrast, micronutrients are vitamins and minerals. These elements and compounds participate in\nmany essential chemical reactions and processes, such as nerve impulses, and some, such as calcium, also\ncontribute to the body’s structure. Your body can store some of the micronutrients in its tissues, and draw on those\nreserves if you fail to consume them in your diet for a few days or weeks. Some others micronutrients, such as\nvitamin C and most of the B vitamins, are water-soluble and cannot be stored, so you need to consume them every\nday or two.\nNarrow Range of Temperature\nYou have probably seen news stories about athletes who died of heat stroke, or hikers who died of exposure to cold.\nSuch deaths occur because the chemical reactions upon which the body depends can only take place within a\nnarrow range of body temperature, from just below to just above 37°C (98.6°F). When body temperature rises well\nabove or drops well below normal, certain proteins (enzymes) that facilitate chemical reactions lose their normal\nstructure and their ability to function and the chemical reactions of metabolism cannot proceed.\nThat said, the body can respond effectively to short-term exposure to heat (Figure 1.8) or cold. One of the body’s\nresponses to heat is, of course, sweating. As sweat evaporates from skin, it removes some thermal energy from the\nbody, cooling it. Adequate water (from the extracellular fluid in the body) is necessary to produce sweat, so\nadequate fluid intake is essential to balance that loss during the sweat response. Not surprisingly, the sweat\nresponse is much less effective in a humid environment because the air is already saturated with water. Thus, the\nsweat on the skin’s surface is not able to evaporate, and internal body temperature can get dangerously high.\n1.4 • Requirements for Human Life\n17\nFIGURE 1.8\nExtreme Heat\nHumans acclimate to some degree to repeated exposure to high temperatures. (credit: McKay Savage/flickr)\nThe body can also respond effectively to short-term exposure to cold. One response to cold is shivering, which is\nrandom muscle movement that generates heat. Another response is increased breakdown of stored energy to\ngenerate heat.', 'Development includes the process of\ndifferentiation, in which unspecialized cells become specialized in structure and function to perform certain tasks\nin the body. Development also includes the processes of growth and repair, both of which involve cell differentiation.\nGrowth is the increase in body size. Humans, like all multicellular organisms, grow by increasing the number of\nexisting cells, increasing the amount of non-cellular material around cells (such as mineral deposits in bone), and,\nwithin very narrow limits, increasing the size of existing cells.\nReproduction is the formation of a new organism from parent organisms. In humans, reproduction is carried out by\nthe male and female reproductive systems. Because death will come to all complex organisms, without\nreproduction, the line of organisms would end.\n1.4 Requirements for Human Life\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss the role of oxygen and nutrients in maintaining human survival\n•\nExplain why extreme heat and extreme cold threaten human survival\n•\nExplain how the pressure exerted by gases and fluids influences human survival\nHumans have been acclimating to life on Earth for at least the past 200,000 years. Earth and its atmosphere have\nprovided us with air to breathe, water to drink, and food to eat, but these are not the only requirements for survival.\nAlthough you may rarely think about it, you also cannot live outside of a certain range of temperature and pressure\nthat the surface of our planet and its atmosphere provides. The next sections explore these four requirements of\nlife.\nOxygen\nAtmospheric air is only about 20 percent oxygen, but that oxygen is a key component of the chemical reactions that\nkeep the body alive, including the reactions that produce ATP. Brain cells are especially sensitive to lack of oxygen\nbecause of their requirement for a high-and-steady production of ATP. Brain damage is likely within five minutes\nwithout oxygen, and death is likely within ten minutes.\n16\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNutrients\nA nutrient is a substance in foods and beverages that is essential to human survival. The three basic classes of\nnutrients are water, the energy-yielding and body-building nutrients, and the micronutrients (vitamins and\nminerals).\nThe most critical nutrient is water.', 'Controlled hypothermia often is used, for example, during open-heart surgery because it decreases the\nmetabolic needs of the brain, heart, and other organs, reducing the risk of damage to them. When controlled\nhypothermia is used clinically, the patient is given medication to prevent shivering. The body is then cooled to\n25–32°C (79–89°F). The heart is stopped and an external heart-lung pump maintains circulation to the patient’s\nbody. The heart is cooled further and is maintained at a temperature below 15°C (60°F) for the duration of the\nsurgery. This very cold temperature helps the heart muscle to tolerate its lack of blood supply during the\nsurgery.\nSome emergency department physicians use controlled hypothermia to reduce damage to the heart in patients\nwho have suffered a cardiac arrest. In the emergency department, the physician induces coma and lowers the\npatient’s body temperature to approximately 91 degrees. This condition, which is maintained for 24 hours,\nslows the patient’s metabolic rate. Because the patient’s organs require less blood to function, the heart’s\nworkload is reduced.\n18\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNarrow Range of Atmospheric Pressure\nPressure is a force exerted by a substance that is in contact with another substance. Atmospheric pressure is\npressure exerted by the mixture of gases (primarily nitrogen and oxygen) in the Earth’s atmosphere. Although you\nmay not perceive it, atmospheric pressure is constantly pressing down on your body. This pressure keeps gases\nwithin your body, such as the gaseous nitrogen in body fluids, dissolved. If you were suddenly ejected from a space\nship above Earth’s atmosphere, you would go from a situation of normal pressure to one of very low pressure. The\npressure of the nitrogen gas in your blood would be much higher than the pressure of nitrogen in the space\nsurrounding your body. As a result, the nitrogen gas in your blood would expand, forming bubbles that could block\nblood vessels and even cause cells to break apart.\nAtmospheric pressure does more than just keep blood gases dissolved. Your ability to breathe—that is, to take in\noxygen and release carbon dioxide—also depends upon a precise atmospheric pressure.', 'Immediate treatment is with\npure oxygen. The affected person is then moved into a hyperbaric chamber. A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,\nclosed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body\nso that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to\nthe body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing\nsome of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.\nThe dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the\npressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body\ntissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the\npulsating flow of pressurized blood.\n1.5 Homeostasis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning\n•\nContrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism\nMaintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body\ntemperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point.\nA set point is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set\nof values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is\napproximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to\nfluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a).', 'Brain cells are especially sensitive to lack of oxygen\nbecause of their requirement for a high-and-steady production of ATP. Brain damage is likely within five minutes\nwithout oxygen, and death is likely within ten minutes.\n16\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNutrients\nA nutrient is a substance in foods and beverages that is essential to human survival. The three basic classes of\nnutrients are water, the energy-yielding and body-building nutrients, and the micronutrients (vitamins and\nminerals).\nThe most critical nutrient is water. Depending on the environmental temperature and our state of health, we may be\nable to survive for only a few days without water. The body’s functional chemicals are dissolved and transported in\nwater, and the chemical reactions of life take place in water. Moreover, water is the largest component of cells,\nblood, and the fluid between cells, and water makes up about 70 percent of an adult’s body mass. Water also helps\nregulate our internal temperature and cushions, protects, and lubricates joints and many other body structures.\nThe energy-yielding nutrients are primarily carbohydrates and lipids, while proteins mainly supply the amino acids\nthat are the building blocks of the body itself. You ingest these in plant and animal foods and beverages, and the\ndigestive system breaks them down into molecules small enough to be absorbed. The breakdown products of\ncarbohydrates and lipids can then be used in the metabolic processes that convert them to ATP. Although you might\nfeel as if you are starving after missing a single meal, you can survive without consuming the energy-yielding\nnutrients for at least several weeks.\nWater and the energy-yielding nutrients are also referred to as macronutrients because the body needs them in\nlarge amounts. In contrast, micronutrients are vitamins and minerals. These elements and compounds participate in\nmany essential chemical reactions and processes, such as nerve impulses, and some, such as calcium, also\ncontribute to the body’s structure. Your body can store some of the micronutrients in its tissues, and draw on those\nreserves if you fail to consume them in your diet for a few days or weeks.

These elements and compounds participate in\nmany essential chemical reactions and processes, such as nerve impulses, and some, such as calcium, also\ncontribute to the body’s structure. Your body can store some of the micronutrients in its tissues, and draw on those\nreserves if you fail to consume them in your diet for a few days or weeks. Some others micronutrients, such as\nvitamin C and most of the B vitamins, are water-soluble and cannot be stored, so you need to consume them every\nday or two.\nNarrow Range of Temperature\nYou have probably seen news stories about athletes who died of heat stroke, or hikers who died of exposure to cold.\nSuch deaths occur because the chemical reactions upon which the body depends can only take place within a\nnarrow range of body temperature, from just below to just above 37°C (98.6°F). When body temperature rises well\nabove or drops well below normal, certain proteins (enzymes) that facilitate chemical reactions lose their normal\nstructure and their ability to function and the chemical reactions of metabolism cannot proceed.\nThat said, the body can respond effectively to short-term exposure to heat (Figure 1.8) or cold. One of the body’s\nresponses to heat is, of course, sweating. As sweat evaporates from skin, it removes some thermal energy from the\nbody, cooling it. Adequate water (from the extracellular fluid in the body) is necessary to produce sweat, so\nadequate fluid intake is essential to balance that loss during the sweat response. Not surprisingly, the sweat\nresponse is much less effective in a humid environment because the air is already saturated with water. Thus, the\nsweat on the skin’s surface is not able to evaporate, and internal body temperature can get dangerously high.\n1.4 • Requirements for Human Life\n17\nFIGURE 1.8\nExtreme Heat\nHumans acclimate to some degree to repeated exposure to high temperatures.

Another response is increased breakdown of stored energy to\ngenerate heat.', 'This rich innervation\nhelps us sense our environment and react accordingly.\nFIGURE 5.15\nLight Micrograph of a Meissner Corpuscle\nIn this micrograph of a skin cross-section, you can see a Meissner corpuscle\n(arrow), a type of touch receptor located in a dermal papilla adjacent to the basement membrane and stratum basale of the overlying\nepidermis.

The sympathetic\nnervous system is continuously monitoring body temperature and initiating appropriate motor responses. Recall\nthat sweat glands, accessory structures to the skin, secrete water, salt, and other substances to cool the body when\nit becomes warm. Even when the body does not appear to be noticeably sweating, approximately 500 mL of sweat\n(insensible perspiration) are secreted a day. If the body becomes excessively warm due to high temperatures,\nvigorous activity (Figure 5.16ac), or a combination of the two, sweat glands will be stimulated by the sympathetic\nnervous system to produce large amounts of sweat, as much as 0.7 to 1.5 L per hour for an active person. When the\nsweat evaporates from the skin surface, the body is cooled as body heat is dissipated.\nIn addition to sweating, arterioles in the dermis dilate so that excess heat carried by the blood can dissipate through\nthe skin and into the surrounding environment (Figure 5.16b). This accounts for the skin redness that many people\nexperience when exercising.\n178\n5 • The Integumentary System\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 5.16\nThermoregulation\nDuring strenuous physical activities, such as skiing (a) or running (c), the dermal blood vessels dilate\nand sweat secretion increases (b).

The affected person is then moved into a hyperbaric chamber. A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,\nclosed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body\nso that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to\nthe body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing\nsome of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.\nThe dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the\npressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body\ntissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the\npulsating flow of pressurized blood.\n1.5 Homeostasis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning\n•\nContrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism\nMaintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body\ntemperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point.\nA set point is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set\nof values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is\napproximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to\nfluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a).', 'Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback.

This value is reported to the control center.\nThe control center is the component in a feedback system that compares the value to the normal range. If the value\ndeviates too much from the set point, then the control center activates an effector. An effector is the component in\na feedback system that causes a change to reverse the situation and return the value to the normal range.\n20\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 1.10\nNegative Feedback System\nIn a negative feedback system, a stimulus—a deviation from a set point—is resisted through\na physiological process that returns the body to homeostasis.

In the posterior\n(dorsal) cavity, the cranial cavity houses the brain, and the spinal cavity (or vertebral cavity) encloses the spinal\ncord. Just as the brain and spinal cord make up a continuous, uninterrupted structure, the cranial and spinal cavities\nthat house them are also continuous. The brain and spinal cord are protected by the bones of the skull and vertebral\ncolumn and by cerebrospinal fluid, a colorless fluid produced by the brain, which cushions the brain and spinal cord\nwithin the posterior (dorsal) cavity.\nThe anterior (ventral) cavity has two main subdivisions: the thoracic cavity and the abdominopelvic cavity (see\nFigure 1.15). The thoracic cavity is the more superior subdivision of the anterior cavity, and it is enclosed by the rib\ncage. The thoracic cavity contains the lungs and the heart, which is located in the mediastinum. The diaphragm\nforms the floor of the thoracic cavity and separates it from the more inferior abdominopelvic cavity. The\nabdominopelvic cavity is the largest cavity in the body. Although no membrane physically divides the\nabdominopelvic cavity, it can be useful to distinguish between the abdominal cavity, the division that houses the\ndigestive organs, and the pelvic cavity, the division that houses the organs of reproduction.', '160\n4 • Critical Thinking Questions\nAccess for free at openstax.org\n32.

The epithelium of the small intestine releases digestive enzymes, for example. Cells lining the\nrespiratory tract secrete mucous that traps incoming microorganisms and particles. A glandular epithelium contains\nmany secretory cells.\nThe Epithelial Cell\nEpithelial cells are typically characterized by the polarized distribution of organelles and membrane-bound proteins\nbetween their basal and apical surfaces. Particular structures found in some epithelial cells are an adaptation to\nspecific functions. Certain organelles are segregated to the basal sides, whereas other organelles and extensions,\nsuch as cilia, when present, are on the apical surface.\nCilia are microscopic extensions of the apical cell membrane that are supported by microtubules. They beat in\nunison and move fluids as well as trapped particles. Ciliated epithelium lines the ventricles of the brain where it\nhelps circulate the cerebrospinal fluid. The ciliated epithelium of your airway forms a mucociliary escalator that\nsweeps particles of dust and pathogens trapped in the secreted mucous toward the throat. It is called an escalator\nbecause it continuously pushes mucous with trapped particles upward. In contrast, nasal cilia sweep the mucous\nblanket down towards your throat. In both cases, the transported materials are usually swallowed, and end up in the\nacidic environment of your stomach.\nCell to Cell Junctions\nCells of epithelia are closely connected and are not separated by intracellular material.

The cells in\nsimple squamous epithelium have the appearance of thin scales. Squamous cell nuclei tend to be flat, horizontal,\nand elliptical, mirroring the form of the cell. The endothelium is the epithelial tissue that lines vessels of the\nlymphatic and cardiovascular system, and it is made up of a single layer of squamous cells.

PET relies on radioactive substances administered\nseveral minutes before the scan.', 'One of the most\nadvanced uses of radioisotopes in medicine is the positron emission tomography (PET) scanner, which detects the\nactivity in the body of a very small injection of radioactive glucose, the simple sugar that cells use for energy. The\nPET camera reveals to the medical team which of the patient’s tissues are taking up the most glucose. Thus, the\nmost metabolically active tissues show up as bright “hot spots” on the images (Figure 2.6). PET can reveal some\ncancerous masses because cancer cells consume glucose at a high rate to fuel their rapid reproduction.\n44\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 2.6\nPET Scan\nPET highlights areas in the body where there is relatively high glucose use, which is characteristic of cancerous\ntissue.

Rather, they are constantly reacting with other\natoms to form and to break down more complex substances. To fully understand anatomy and physiology you must\ngrasp how atoms participate in such reactions. The key is understanding the behavior of electrons.\nAlthough electrons do not follow rigid orbits a set distance away from the atom’s nucleus, they do tend to stay\nwithin certain regions of space called electron shells. An electron shell is a layer of electrons that encircle the\nnucleus at a distinct energy level.\nThe atoms of the elements found in the human body have from one to five electron shells, and all electron shells\nhold eight electrons except the first shell, which can only hold two. This configuration of electron shells is the same\nfor all atoms. The precise number of shells depends on the number of electrons in the atom. Hydrogen and helium\nhave just one and two electrons, respectively. If you take a look at the periodic table of the elements, you will notice\nthat hydrogen and helium are placed alone on either sides of the top row; they are the only elements that have just\none electron shell (Figure 2.7). A second shell is necessary to hold the electrons in all elements larger than hydrogen\nand helium.\nLithium (Li), whose atomic number is 3, has three electrons.']","PET is used to diagnose a variety of conditions, including heart disease, the spread of cancer, certain forms of infection, brain abnormalities, bone disease, and thyroid disease.","PET is widely used to diagnose a multitude of conditions, such as heart disease, the spread of cancer, certain forms of infection, brain abnormalities, bone disease, and thyroid disease."

What type of radiation does a CT scanner use?,"['(credit a: Akira Ohgaki/flickr; credit b: “Digital Cate”/flickr;\ncredit c: “Raziel”/Wikimedia Commons; credit d: “Isis”/Wikimedia Commons)\nSince 1970, the development of more powerful computers and more sophisticated software has made CT scanning\nroutine for many types of diagnostic evaluations. It is especially useful for soft tissue scanning, such as of the brain\nand the thoracic and abdominal viscera. Its level of detail is so precise that it can allow physicians to measure the\nsize of a mass down to a millimeter. The main disadvantage of CT scanning is that it exposes patients to a dose of\nradiation many times higher than that of X-rays. In fact, children who undergo CT scans are at increased risk of\ndeveloping cancer, as are adults who have multiple CT scans.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nA CT or CAT scan relies on a circling scanner that revolves around the patient’s body.

What type of radiation does a CT scanner\nuse?\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive medical imaging technique based on a phenomenon of nuclear\nphysics discovered in the 1930s, in which matter exposed to magnetic fields and radio waves was found to emit\nradio signals. In 1970, a physician and researcher named Raymond Damadian noticed that malignant (cancerous)\ntissue gave off different signals than normal body tissue. He applied for a patent for the first MRI scanning device,\nwhich was in use clinically by the early 1980s. The early MRI scanners were crude, but advances in digital\ncomputing and electronics led to their advancement over any other technique for precise imaging, especially to\ndiscover tumors. MRI also has the major advantage of not exposing patients to radiation.\nDrawbacks of MRI scans include their much higher cost, and patient discomfort with the procedure. The MRI\nscanner subjects the patient to such powerful electromagnets that the scan room must be shielded.', 'The body’s\norgans are organized in one of two main\ncavities—dorsal (also referred to posterior) and ventral\n(also referred to anterior)—which are further sub-\ndivided according to the structures present in each\narea.

Protons and\nneutrons contribute nearly all of an atom’s mass; the\nnumber of protons and neutrons is an element’s mass\nnumber. Heavier and lighter versions of the same\nelement can occur in nature because these versions\nhave different numbers of neutrons. Different versions\nof an element are called isotopes.\nThe tendency of an atom to be stable or to react readily\nwith other atoms is largely due to the behavior of the\nelectrons within the atom’s outermost electron shell,\ncalled its valence shell.', 'Each element’s name can be replaced by a one- or\ntwo-letter symbol; you will become familiar with some of these during this course.

Dragoset, A. Musgrove, C.W. Clark, W.C. Martin)\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nVisit this website (http://openstax.org/l/ptable) to view the periodic table. In the periodic table of the elements,\nelements in a single column have the same number of electrons that can participate in a chemical reaction.

What is the meaning of a mass\nnumber shown in parentheses?\nIsotopes\nAlthough each element has a unique number of protons, it can exist as different isotopes. An isotope is one of the\ndifferent forms of an element, distinguished from one another by different numbers of neutrons. The standard\nisotope of carbon is 12C, commonly called carbon twelve. 12C has six protons and six neutrons, for a mass number of\ntwelve. All of the isotopes of carbon have the same number of protons; therefore, 13C has seven neutrons, and 14C\nhas eight neutrons. The different isotopes of an element can also be indicated with the mass number hyphenated\n(for example, C-12 instead of 12C). Hydrogen has three common isotopes, shown in Figure 2.5.', ""The electrical activity that derives from the\ninteractions of the charged ions is why they are also called electrolytes.\nCovalent Bonds\nUnlike ionic bonds formed by the attraction between a cation’s positive charge and an anion’s negative charge,\nmolecules formed by a covalent bond share electrons in a mutually stabilizing relationship. Like next-door\nneighbors whose kids hang out first at one home and then at the other, the atoms do not lose or gain electrons\npermanently. Instead, the electrons move back and forth between the elements. Because of the close sharing of\npairs of electrons (one electron from each of two atoms), covalent bonds are stronger than ionic bonds.\nNonpolar Covalent Bonds\nFigure 2.9 shows several common types of covalent bonds. Notice that the two covalently bonded atoms typically\nshare just one or two electron pairs, though larger sharings are possible. The important concept to take from this is\nthat in covalent bonds, electrons in the two atoms' overlapping atomic orbitals are shared to fill the valence shells of\nboth atoms, ultimately stabilizing both of the atoms involved. In a single covalent bond, a single electron pair is\nshared between two atoms, while in a double covalent bond, two pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms.\nThere even are triple covalent bonds, where three electron pairs are shared between two atoms.\nFIGURE 2.9\nCovalent Bonding\nYou can see that the covalent bonds shown in Figure 2.9 are balanced. The sharing of the negative electrons is\nrelatively equal, as is the electrical pull of the positive protons in the nucleus of the atoms involved. This is why\ncovalently bonded molecules that are electrically balanced in this way are described as nonpolar; that is, no region\nof the molecule is either more positive or more negative than any other.\nPolar Covalent Bonds\nGroups of legislators with completely opposite views on a particular issue are often described as “polarized” by\nnews writers. In chemistry, a polar molecule is a molecule that contains regions that have opposite electrical\ncharges. Polar molecules occur when atoms share electrons unequally, in polar covalent bonds.\n2.2 • Chemical Bonds\n49\nThe most familiar example of a polar molecule is water (Figure 2.10)."", 'The same is true for neutrons and electrons.

What is the valence shell?,"['The factor that most strongly governs the tendency of an atom to participate in chemical reactions is the number of\nelectrons in its valence shell. A valence shell is an atom’s outermost electron shell. If the valence shell is full, the\natom is stable; meaning its electrons are unlikely to be pulled away from the nucleus by the electrical charge of\nother atoms. If the valence shell is not full, the atom is reactive; meaning it will tend to react with other atoms in\nways that make the valence shell full. Consider hydrogen, with its one electron only half-filling its valence shell. This\nsingle electron is likely to be drawn into relationships with the atoms of other elements, so that hydrogen’s single\nvalence shell can be stabilized.\nAll atoms (except hydrogen and helium with their single electron shells) are most stable when there are exactly\neight electrons in their valence shell. This principle is referred to as the octet rule, and it states that an atom will give\nup, gain, or share electrons with another atom so that it ends up with eight electrons in its own valence shell. For\nexample, oxygen, with six electrons in its valence shell, is likely to react with other atoms in a way that results in the\naddition of two electrons to oxygen’s valence shell, bringing the number to eight. When two hydrogen atoms each\nshare their single electron with oxygen, covalent bonds are formed, resulting in a molecule of water, H2O.\nIn nature, atoms of one element tend to join with atoms of other elements in characteristic ways. For example,\ncarbon commonly fills its valence shell by linking up with four atoms of hydrogen. In so doing, the two elements\nform the simplest of organic molecules, methane, which also is one of the most abundant and stable carbon-\ncontaining compounds on Earth. As stated above, another example is water; oxygen needs two electrons to fill its\nvalence shell. It commonly interacts with two atoms of hydrogen, forming H2O. Incidentally, the name “hydrogen”\nreflects its contribution to water (hydro- = “water”; -gen = “maker”).', 'A bond is a weak or strong electrical attraction that holds atoms in\nthe same vicinity. The new grouping is typically more stable—less likely to react again—than its component atoms\nwere when they were separate. A more or less stable grouping of two or more atoms held together by chemical\nbonds is called a molecule. The bonded atoms may be of the same element, as in the case of H2, which is called\nmolecular hydrogen or hydrogen gas. When a molecule is made up of two or more atoms of different elements, it is\ncalled a chemical compound. Thus, a unit of water, or H2O, is a compound, as is a single molecule of the gas\nmethane, or CH4.\nThree types of chemical bonds are important in human physiology, because they hold together substances that are\nused by the body for critical aspects of homeostasis, signaling, and energy production, to name just a few important\nprocesses. These are ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds.\nIons and Ionic Bonds\nRecall that an atom typically has the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons.\nAs long as this situation remains, the atom is electrically neutral. But when an atom participates in a chemical\nreaction that results in the donation or acceptance of one or more electrons, the atom will then become positively or\nnegatively charged. This happens frequently for most atoms in order to have a full valence shell, as described\npreviously. This can happen either by gaining electrons to fill a shell that is more than half-full, or by giving away\nelectrons to empty a shell that is less than half-full, thereby leaving the next smaller electron shell as the new, full,\nvalence shell. An atom that has an electrical charge—whether positive or negative—is an ion.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nVisit this website (http://openstax.org/l/electenergy) to learn about electrical energy and the attraction/repulsion of\ncharges.

You obtain these\nelements from the foods you eat and the air you\nbreathe. The smallest unit of an element that retains all\nof the properties of that element is an atom. But,\natoms themselves contain many subatomic particles,\nthe three most important of which are protons,\nneutrons, and electrons. These particles do not vary in\nquality from one element to another; rather, what gives\nan element its distinctive identification is the quantity\nof its protons, called its atomic number. Protons and\nneutrons contribute nearly all of an atom’s mass; the\nnumber of protons and neutrons is an element’s mass\nnumber. Heavier and lighter versions of the same\nelement can occur in nature because these versions\nhave different numbers of neutrons. Different versions\nof an element are called isotopes.\nThe tendency of an atom to be stable or to react readily\nwith other atoms is largely due to the behavior of the\nelectrons within the atom’s outermost electron shell,\ncalled its valence shell.']","The valence shell is the outermost electron shell of an atom, which determines the atom's stability and its tendency to participate in chemical reactions based on the number of electrons it contains.",An atom's outermost electron shell.
Where is the number of electrons in an atom's valence shell most strongly governed to participate in chemical reactions?,"['The factor that most strongly governs the tendency of an atom to participate in chemical reactions is the number of\nelectrons in its valence shell. A valence shell is an atom’s outermost electron shell. If the valence shell is full, the\natom is stable; meaning its electrons are unlikely to be pulled away from the nucleus by the electrical charge of\nother atoms. If the valence shell is not full, the atom is reactive; meaning it will tend to react with other atoms in\nways that make the valence shell full. Consider hydrogen, with its one electron only half-filling its valence shell. This\nsingle electron is likely to be drawn into relationships with the atoms of other elements, so that hydrogen’s single\nvalence shell can be stabilized.\nAll atoms (except hydrogen and helium with their single electron shells) are most stable when there are exactly\neight electrons in their valence shell. This principle is referred to as the octet rule, and it states that an atom will give\nup, gain, or share electrons with another atom so that it ends up with eight electrons in its own valence shell. For\nexample, oxygen, with six electrons in its valence shell, is likely to react with other atoms in a way that results in the\naddition of two electrons to oxygen’s valence shell, bringing the number to eight. When two hydrogen atoms each\nshare their single electron with oxygen, covalent bonds are formed, resulting in a molecule of water, H2O.\nIn nature, atoms of one element tend to join with atoms of other elements in characteristic ways. For example,\ncarbon commonly fills its valence shell by linking up with four atoms of hydrogen. In so doing, the two elements\nform the simplest of organic molecules, methane, which also is one of the most abundant and stable carbon-\ncontaining compounds on Earth. As stated above, another example is water; oxygen needs two electrons to fill its\nvalence shell. It commonly interacts with two atoms of hydrogen, forming H2O. Incidentally, the name “hydrogen”\nreflects its contribution to water (hydro- = “water”; -gen = “maker”).', 'The precise number of shells depends on the number of electrons in the atom. Hydrogen and helium\nhave just one and two electrons, respectively. If you take a look at the periodic table of the elements, you will notice\nthat hydrogen and helium are placed alone on either sides of the top row; they are the only elements that have just\none electron shell (Figure 2.7). A second shell is necessary to hold the electrons in all elements larger than hydrogen\nand helium.\nLithium (Li), whose atomic number is 3, has three electrons. Two of these fill the first electron shell, and the third\nspills over into a second shell. The second electron shell can accommodate as many as eight electrons. Carbon, with\nits six electrons, entirely fills its first shell, and half-fills its second. With ten electrons, neon (Ne) entirely fills its two\nelectron shells. Again, a look at the periodic table reveals that all of the elements in the second row, from lithium to\nneon, have just two electron shells. Atoms with more than ten electrons require more than two shells. These\nelements occupy the third and subsequent rows of the periodic table.\n2.1 • Elements and Atoms: The Building Blocks of Matter\n45\nFIGURE 2.7\nElectron Shells\nElectrons orbit the atomic nucleus at distinct levels of energy called electron shells. (a) With one electron,\nhydrogen only half-fills its electron shell. Helium also has a single shell, but its two electrons completely fill it. (b) The electrons of carbon\ncompletely fill its first electron shell, but only half-fills its second. (c) Neon, an element that does not occur in the body, has 10 electrons,\nfilling both of its electron shells.\nThe factor that most strongly governs the tendency of an atom to participate in chemical reactions is the number of\nelectrons in its valence shell.

The new grouping is typically more stable—less likely to react again—than its component atoms\nwere when they were separate. A more or less stable grouping of two or more atoms held together by chemical\nbonds is called a molecule. The bonded atoms may be of the same element, as in the case of H2, which is called\nmolecular hydrogen or hydrogen gas. When a molecule is made up of two or more atoms of different elements, it is\ncalled a chemical compound. Thus, a unit of water, or H2O, is a compound, as is a single molecule of the gas\nmethane, or CH4.\nThree types of chemical bonds are important in human physiology, because they hold together substances that are\nused by the body for critical aspects of homeostasis, signaling, and energy production, to name just a few important\nprocesses. These are ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds.\nIons and Ionic Bonds\nRecall that an atom typically has the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons.\nAs long as this situation remains, the atom is electrically neutral. But when an atom participates in a chemical\nreaction that results in the donation or acceptance of one or more electrons, the atom will then become positively or\nnegatively charged. This happens frequently for most atoms in order to have a full valence shell, as described\npreviously. This can happen either by gaining electrons to fill a shell that is more than half-full, or by giving away\nelectrons to empty a shell that is less than half-full, thereby leaving the next smaller electron shell as the new, full,\nvalence shell.

The\nPET camera reveals to the medical team which of the patient’s tissues are taking up the most glucose. Thus, the\nmost metabolically active tissues show up as bright “hot spots” on the images (Figure 2.6). PET can reveal some\ncancerous masses because cancer cells consume glucose at a high rate to fuel their rapid reproduction.\n44\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 2.6\nPET Scan\nPET highlights areas in the body where there is relatively high glucose use, which is characteristic of cancerous\ntissue.

Rather, they are constantly reacting with other\natoms to form and to break down more complex substances. To fully understand anatomy and physiology you must\ngrasp how atoms participate in such reactions. The key is understanding the behavior of electrons.\nAlthough electrons do not follow rigid orbits a set distance away from the atom’s nucleus, they do tend to stay\nwithin certain regions of space called electron shells. An electron shell is a layer of electrons that encircle the\nnucleus at a distinct energy level.\nThe atoms of the elements found in the human body have from one to five electron shells, and all electron shells\nhold eight electrons except the first shell, which can only hold two. This configuration of electron shells is the same\nfor all atoms. The precise number of shells depends on the number of electrons in the atom.

In chemistry, a polar molecule is a molecule that contains regions that have opposite electrical\ncharges. Polar molecules occur when atoms share electrons unequally, in polar covalent bonds.\n2.2 • Chemical Bonds\n49\nThe most familiar example of a polar molecule is water (Figure 2.10). The molecule has three parts: one atom of\noxygen, the nucleus of which contains eight protons, and two hydrogen atoms, whose nuclei each contain only one\nproton. Because every proton exerts an identical positive charge, a nucleus that contains eight protons exerts a\ncharge eight times greater than a nucleus that contains one proton. This means that the negatively charged\nelectrons present in the water molecule are more strongly attracted to the oxygen nucleus than to the hydrogen\nnuclei. Each hydrogen atom’s single negative electron therefore migrates toward the oxygen atom, making the\noxygen end of their bond slightly more negative than the hydrogen end of their bond.\nFIGURE 2.10\nPolar Covalent Bonds in a Water Molecule\nWhat is true for the bonds is true for the water molecule as a whole; that is, the oxygen region has a slightly negative\ncharge and the regions of the hydrogen atoms have a slightly positive charge. These charges are often referred to as\n“partial charges” because the strength of the charge is less than one full electron, as would occur in an ionic bond.\nAs shown in Figure 2.10, regions of weak polarity are indicated with the Greek letter delta (δ) and a plus (+) or minus\n(–) sign.\nEven though a single water molecule is unimaginably tiny, it has mass, and the opposing electrical charges on the\nmolecule pull that mass in such a way that it creates a shape somewhat like a triangular tent (see Figure 2.10b).\nThis dipole, with the positive charges at one end formed by the hydrogen atoms at the “bottom” of the tent and the\nnegative charge at the opposite end (the oxygen atom at the “top” of the tent) makes the charged regions highly\nlikely to interact with charged regions of other polar molecules. For human physiology, the resulting bond is one of\nthe most important formed by water—the hydrogen bond.', 'A bond is a weak or strong electrical attraction that holds atoms in\nthe same vicinity.

Just 20 different amino acids\ncontribute to nearly all of the thousands of different proteins important in human structure and function. Body\nproteins contain a unique combination of a few dozen to a few hundred of these 20 amino acid monomers. All 20 of\nthese amino acids share a similar structure (Figure 2.24).

This group can vary in size and can be polar or nonpolar, giving each amino acid its unique\ncharacteristics. For example, the side chains of two amino acids—cysteine and methionine—contain sulfur. Sulfur\ndoes not readily participate in hydrogen bonds, whereas all other amino acids do. This variation influences the way\nthat proteins containing cysteine and methionine are assembled.\nAmino acids join via dehydration synthesis to form protein polymers (Figure 2.25).

An\nelement is a pure substance that is distinguished from all other matter by the fact that it cannot be created or\nbroken down by ordinary chemical means. While your body can assemble many of the chemical compounds needed\nfor life from their constituent elements, it cannot make elements. They must come from the environment. A familiar\nexample of an element that you must take in is calcium (Ca). Calcium is essential to the human body; it is absorbed\nand used for a number of processes, including strengthening bones. When you consume dairy products your\ndigestive system breaks down the food into components small enough to cross into the bloodstream. Among these\nis calcium, which, because it is an element, cannot be broken down further. The elemental calcium in cheese,\ntherefore, is the same as the calcium that forms your bones. Some other elements you might be familiar with are\noxygen, sodium, and iron.

However, modern cosmetic procedures, such as\ndermabrasion, laser treatments, and filler injections have been invented as remedies for severe scarring. All of these\nprocedures try to reorganize the structure of the epidermis and underlying collagen tissue to make it look more\nnatural.\nBedsores and Stretch Marks\nSkin and its underlying tissue can be affected by excessive pressure. One example of this is called a bedsore.\nBedsores, also called decubitis ulcers, are caused by constant, long-term, unrelieved pressure on certain body parts\nthat are bony, reducing blood flow to the area and leading to necrosis (tissue death). Bedsores are most common in\nelderly patients who have debilitating conditions that cause them to be immobile. Most hospitals and long-term care\nfacilities have the practice of turning the patients every few hours to prevent the incidence of bedsores. If left\nuntreated by removal of necrotized tissue, bedsores can be fatal if they become infected.\nThe skin can also be affected by pressure associated with rapid growth. A stretch mark results when the dermis is\nstretched beyond its limits of elasticity, as the skin stretches to accommodate the excess pressure. Stretch marks\nusually accompany rapid weight gain during puberty and pregnancy. They initially have a reddish hue, but lighten\nover time. Other than for cosmetic reasons, treatment of stretch marks is not required. They occur most commonly\nover the hips and abdomen.\nCalluses\nWhen you wear shoes that do not fit well and are a constant source of abrasion on your toes, you tend to form a\ncallus at the point of contact. This occurs because the basal stem cells in the stratum basale are triggered to divide\nmore often to increase the thickness of the skin at the point of abrasion to protect the rest of the body from further\ndamage. This is an example of a minor or local injury, and the skin manages to react and treat the problem\nindependent of the rest of the body.']","Hydrogen bonding commonly occurs between molecules of water, as seen when raindrops merge or when water interacts with other polar molecules and ions.","It commonly occurs between molecules of water, such as when two raindrops merge into a larger bead or a creek spills into a river."

It works by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to occur.,A substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any change.
Where is the explanation of the activation energy in the context of chemical reactions located?,"['Enzymes and Other Catalysts\nFor two chemicals in nature to react with each other they first have to come into contact, and this occurs through\nrandom collisions. Because heat helps increase the kinetic energy of atoms, ions, and molecules, it promotes their\ncollision. But in the body, extremely high heat—such as a very high fever—can damage body cells and be life-\nthreatening. On the other hand, normal body temperature is not high enough to promote the chemical reactions that\nsustain life. That is where catalysts come in.\nIn chemistry, a catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any\nchange. You can think of a catalyst as a chemical change agent. They help increase the rate and force at which\natoms, ions, and molecules collide, thereby increasing the probability that their valence shell electrons will interact.\nThe most important catalysts in the human body are enzymes. An enzyme is a catalyst composed of protein or\nribonucleic acid (RNA), both of which will be discussed later in this chapter. Like all catalysts, enzymes work by\nlowering the level of energy that needs to be invested in a chemical reaction. A chemical reaction’s activation\nenergy is the “threshold” level of energy needed to break the bonds in the reactants. Once those bonds are broken,\nnew arrangements can form. Without an enzyme to act as a catalyst, a much larger investment of energy is needed\nto ignite a chemical reaction (Figure 2.13).\nFIGURE 2.13\nEnzymes\nEnzymes decrease the activation energy required for a given chemical reaction to occur. (a) Without an enzyme,\nthe energy input needed for a reaction to begin is high. (b) With the help of an enzyme, less energy is needed for a reaction to begin.\nEnzymes are critical to the body’s healthy functioning. They assist, for example, with the breakdown of food and its\nconversion to energy.

Potential energy is the energy of position, or the energy matter possesses because of the\npositioning or structure of its components. If the brick wall collapses, the stored potential energy is released as\nkinetic energy as the bricks fall.\nIn the human body, potential energy is stored in the bonds between atoms and molecules. Chemical energy is the\nform of potential energy in which energy is stored in chemical bonds. When those bonds are formed, chemical\nenergy is invested, and when they break, chemical energy is released. Notice that chemical energy, like all energy, is\nneither created nor destroyed; rather, it is converted from one form to another. When you eat an energy bar before\nheading out the door for a hike, the honey, nuts, and other foods the bar contains are broken down and rearranged\nby your body into molecules that your muscle cells convert to kinetic energy.\n2.3 • Chemical Reactions\n51\nChemical reactions that release more energy than they absorb are characterized as exergonic. The catabolism of the\nfoods in your energy bar is an example. Some of the chemical energy stored in the bar is absorbed into molecules\nyour body uses for fuel, but some of it is released—for example, as heat. In contrast, chemical reactions that absorb\nmore energy than they release are endergonic. These reactions require energy input, and the resulting molecule\nstores not only the chemical energy in the original components, but also the energy that fueled the reaction.\nBecause energy is neither created nor destroyed, where does the energy needed for endergonic reactions come\nfrom? In many cases, it comes from exergonic reactions.\nForms of Energy Important in Human Functioning\nYou have already learned that chemical energy is absorbed, stored, and released by chemical bonds. In addition to\nchemical energy, mechanical, radiant, and electrical energy are important in human functioning.\n•\nMechanical energy, which is stored in physical systems such as machines, engines, or the human body, directly\npowers the movement of matter. When you lift a brick into place on a wall, your muscles provide the mechanical\nenergy that moves the brick.\n•\nRadiant energy is energy emitted and transmitted as waves rather than matter. These waves vary in length from\nlong radio waves and microwaves to short gamma waves emitted from decaying atomic nuclei.', 'In contrast, RNA consists of a single strand of sugar-phosphate backbone studded with bases. Messenger RNA\n(mRNA) is created during protein synthesis to carry the genetic instructions from the DNA to the cell’s protein\nmanufacturing plants in the cytoplasm, the ribosomes.\nAdenosine Triphosphate\nThe nucleotide adenosine triphosphate (ATP), is composed of a ribose sugar, an adenine base, and three phosphate\ngroups (Figure 2.30). ATP is classified as a high energy compound because the two covalent bonds linking its three\nphosphates store a significant amount of potential energy. In the body, the energy released from these high energy\nbonds helps fuel the body’s activities, from muscle contraction to the transport of substances in and out of cells to\nanabolic chemical reactions.\n2.5 • Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n73\nFIGURE 2.30\nStructure of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)\nWhen a phosphate group is cleaved from ATP, the products are adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic\nphosphate (Pi). This hydrolysis reaction can be written:\nRemoval of a second phosphate leaves adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and two phosphate groups. Again, these\nreactions also liberate the energy that had been stored in the phosphate-phosphate bonds. They are reversible, too,\nas when ADP undergoes phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is the addition of a phosphate group to an organic\ncompound, in this case, resulting in ATP. In such cases, the same level of energy that had been released during\nhydrolysis must be reinvested to power dehydration synthesis.\nCells can also transfer a phosphate group from ATP to another organic compound. For example, when glucose first\nenters a cell, a phosphate group is transferred from ATP, forming glucose phosphate (C6H12O6—P) and ADP. Once\nglucose is phosphorylated in this way, it can be stored as glycogen or metabolized for immediate energy.\n74\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nKey Terms\nacid\ncompound that releases hydrogen ions (H+) in\nsolution\nactivation energy\namount of energy greater than the\nenergy contained in the reactants,', 'Water molecules also repel\nmolecules with nonpolar covalent bonds, like fats, lipids, and oils. You can demonstrate this with a simple kitchen\nexperiment: pour a teaspoon of vegetable oil, a compound formed by nonpolar covalent bonds, into a glass of water.\nInstead of instantly dissolving in the water, the oil forms a distinct bead because the polar water molecules repel the\nnonpolar oil.\n2.3 Chemical Reactions\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDistinguish between kinetic and potential energy, and between exergonic and endergonic chemical reactions\n•\nIdentify four forms of energy important in human functioning\n•\nDescribe the three basic types of chemical reactions\n•\nIdentify several factors influencing the rate of chemical reactions\nOne characteristic of a living organism is metabolism, which is the sum total of all of the chemical reactions that go\non to maintain that organism’s health and life. The bonding processes you have learned thus far are anabolic\nchemical reactions; that is, they form larger molecules from smaller molecules or atoms. But recall that metabolism\ncan proceed in another direction: in catabolic chemical reactions, bonds between components of larger molecules\nbreak, releasing smaller molecules or atoms. Both types of reaction involve exchanges not only of matter, but of\nenergy.\nThe Role of Energy in Chemical Reactions\nChemical reactions require a sufficient amount of energy to cause the matter to collide with enough precision and\nforce that old chemical bonds can be broken and new ones formed. In general, kinetic energy is the form of energy\npowering any type of matter in motion. Imagine you are building a brick wall. The energy it takes to lift and place one\nbrick atop another is kinetic energy—the energy matter possesses because of its motion. Once the wall is in place, it\nstores potential energy. Potential energy is the energy of position, or the energy matter possesses because of the\npositioning or structure of its components. If the brick wall collapses, the stored potential energy is released as\nkinetic energy as the bricks fall.\nIn the human body, potential energy is stored in the bonds between atoms and molecules. Chemical energy is the\nform of potential energy in which energy is stored in chemical bonds. When those bonds are formed, chemical\nenergy is invested, and when they break, chemical energy is released.']","The explanation of activation energy in the context of chemical reactions is located in the section discussing how enzymes lower the activation energy needed for a chemical reaction to occur, highlighting that activation energy is the ""threshold"" level of energy required to break bonds in reactants.",The explanation of the activation energy is located in the text where it is described as the 'threshold' level of energy needed to break the bonds in the reactants.

Acids typically have a sour taste and can react with bases to form salts and water.","An acid is a substance that releases hydrogen ions (H+) in solution. A hydrogen ion is simply a proton, which is highly likely to participate in chemical reactions."
Where do hydrochloric acid and other strong acids release their H+ ions?,"['Many other salts are important in the body. For example, bile salts produced by the liver help break apart dietary\nfats, and calcium phosphate salts form the mineral portion of teeth and bones.\nAcids and Bases\nAcids and bases, like salts, dissociate in water into electrolytes. Acids and bases can very much change the\nproperties of the solutions in which they are dissolved.\nAcids\nAn acid is a substance that releases hydrogen ions (H+) in solution (Figure 2.16a). Because an atom of hydrogen has\njust one proton and one electron, a positively charged hydrogen ion is simply a proton. This solitary proton is highly\nlikely to participate in chemical reactions. Strong acids are compounds that release all of their H+ in solution; that is,\nthey ionize completely. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is released from cells in the lining of the stomach, is a strong\nacid because it releases all of its H+ in the stomach’s watery environment. This strong acid aids in digestion and kills\ningested microbes. Weak acids do not ionize completely; that is, some of their hydrogen ions remain bonded within a\ncompound in solution. An example of a weak acid is vinegar, or acetic acid; it is called acetate after it gives up a\nproton.\n58\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 2.16\nAcids and Bases\n(a) In aqueous solution, an acid dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+) and anions.

Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–.\nBases\nA base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+ already present in\nsolution (see Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine\nwith H+ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+ and reducing the solution’s acidity.', '(b) In aqueous solution, a base dissociates into hydroxyl ions (OH–) and\ncations. Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–.\nBases\nA base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+ already present in\nsolution (see Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine\nwith H+ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+ and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases\nrelease most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H+. Food\nmixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract\nafter the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3–), a weak base that attracts H+. Bicarbonate\naccepts some of the H+ protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.\nThe Concept of pH\nThe relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution’s pH is the negative, base-10\nlogarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+\nconcentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times\nmore acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH.', 'An atom of oxygen and two\natoms of hydrogen form water molecules by means of\npolar covalent bonds. Hydrogen bonds link hydrogen\natoms already participating in polar covalent bonds to\nanions or electronegative regions of other polar\nmolecules. Hydrogen bonds link water molecules,\nresulting in the properties of water that are important\nto living things.\n2.3 Chemical Reactions\nChemical reactions, in which chemical bonds are\nbroken and formed, require an initial investment of\nenergy. Kinetic energy, the energy of matter in motion,\nfuels the collisions of atoms, ions, and molecules that\nare necessary if their old bonds are to break and new\nones to form. All molecules store potential energy,\nwhich is released when their bonds are broken.\nFour forms of energy essential to human functioning\nare: chemical energy, which is stored and released as\nchemical bonds are formed and broken; mechanical\nenergy, which directly powers physical activity; radiant\nenergy, emitted as waves such as in sunlight; and\nelectrical energy, the power of moving electrons.\nChemical reactions begin with reactants and end with\nproducts. Synthesis reactions bond reactants together,\na process that requires energy, whereas decomposition\nreactions break the bonds within a reactant and\nthereby release energy. In exchange reactions, bonds\nare both broken and formed, and energy is exchanged.\nThe rate at which chemical reactions occur is\ninfluenced by several properties of the reactants:\ntemperature, concentration and pressure, and the\npresence or absence of a catalyst. An enzyme is a\ncatalytic protein that speeds up chemical reactions in\nthe human body.\n2.4 Inorganic Compounds Essential to\nHuman Functioning\nInorganic compounds essential to human functioning\ninclude water, salts, acids, and bases. These\ncompounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain\nboth hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and\ncushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a\nbyproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a\nreactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\nsolution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H+,\nthereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).', 'These\ncompounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain\nboth hydrogen and carbon.

All body cells can use glucose for fuel.', 'FIGURE 2.13\nEnzymes\nEnzymes decrease the activation energy required for a given chemical reaction to occur. (a) Without an enzyme,\nthe energy input needed for a reaction to begin is high. (b) With the help of an enzyme, less energy is needed for a reaction to begin.\nEnzymes are critical to the body’s healthy functioning. They assist, for example, with the breakdown of food and its\nconversion to energy. In fact, most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by enzymes.\n2.4 Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nCompare and contrast inorganic and organic compounds\n•\nIdentify the properties of water that make it essential to life\n•\nExplain the role of salts in body functioning\n•\nDistinguish between acids and bases, and explain their role in pH\n•\nDiscuss the role of buffers in helping the body maintain pH homeostasis\n54\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe concepts you have learned so far in this chapter govern all forms of matter, and would work as a foundation for\ngeology as well as biology.

There are three types of anchoring junctions: desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, and adherens.\nDesmosomes occur in patches on the membranes of cells. The patches are structural proteins on the inner surface\nof the cell’s membrane. The adhesion molecule, cadherin, is embedded in these patches and projects through the\ncell membrane to link with the cadherin molecules of adjacent cells. These connections are especially important in\nholding cells together. Hemidesmosomes, which look like half a desmosome, link cells to the extracellular matrix,\nfor example, the basal lamina. While similar in appearance to desmosomes, they include the adhesion proteins\ncalled integrins rather than cadherins. Adherens junctions use either cadherins or integrins depending on whether\nthey are linking to other cells or matrix. The junctions are characterized by the presence of the contractile protein\nactin located on the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. The actin can connect isolated patches or form a\nbelt-like structure inside the cell. These junctions influence the shape and folding of the epithelial tissue.']","The three important disaccharides (sucrose, lactose, and maltose) are formed in the digestive tract through dehydration synthesis.",They are formed in the digestive tract via hydrolysis.

Why is receptor-mediated endocytosis said to be\nmore selective than phagocytosis or pinocytosis?\n32.', 'Translation is the process of synthesizing a chain of amino acids called a\npolypeptide. Translation requires two major aids: first, a “translator,” the molecule that will conduct the translation,\nand second, a substrate on which the mRNA strand is translated into a new protein, like the translator’s “desk.” Both\nof these requirements are fulfilled by other types of RNA. The substrate on which translation takes place is the\nribosome.\nRemember that many of a cell’s ribosomes are found associated with the rough ER, and carry out the synthesis of\nproteins destined for the Golgi apparatus. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a type of RNA that, together with proteins,\ncomposes the structure of the ribosome. Ribosomes exist in the cytoplasm as two distinct components, a small and\na large subunit. When an mRNA molecule is ready to be translated, the two subunits come together and attach to\nthe mRNA. The ribosome provides a substrate for translation, bringing together and aligning the mRNA molecule\nwith the molecular “translators” that must decipher its code.\nThe other major requirement for protein synthesis is the translator molecules that physically “read” the mRNA\ncodons. Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a type of RNA that ferries the appropriate corresponding amino acids to the\nribosome, and attaches each new amino acid to the last, building the polypeptide chain one-by-one. Thus tRNA\ntransfers specific amino acids from the cytoplasm to a growing polypeptide. The tRNA molecules must be able to\nrecognize the codons on mRNA and match them with the correct amino acid. The tRNA is modified for this function.\nOn one end of its structure is a binding site for a specific amino acid. On the other end is a base sequence that\nmatches the codon specifying its particular amino acid. This sequence of three bases on the tRNA molecule is called\nan anticodon. For example, a tRNA responsible for shuttling the amino acid glycine contains a binding site for\nglycine on one end. On the other end it contains an anticodon that complements the glycine codon (GGA is a codon\nfor glycine, and so the tRNAs anticodon would read CCU).', 'Cholesterol is an\nimportant component of bile acids, compounds that help emulsify dietary fats. In fact, the word root chole- refers to\nbile. Cholesterol is also a building block of many hormones, signaling molecules that the body releases to regulate\nprocesses at distant sites. Finally, like phospholipids, cholesterol molecules are found in the cell membrane, where\ntheir hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions help regulate the flow of substances into and out of the cell.\nProstaglandins\nLike a hormone, a prostaglandin is one of a group of signaling molecules, but prostaglandins are derived from\nunsaturated fatty acids (see Figure 2.23c). One reason that the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish are beneficial is\nthat they stimulate the production of certain prostaglandins that help regulate aspects of blood pressure and\ninflammation, and thereby reduce the risk for heart disease.

(d) The quaternary structure occurs as a result of interactions between two or more tertiary subunits. The\nexample shown here is hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells which transports oxygen to body tissues.\nAlthough some polypeptides exist as linear chains, most are twisted or folded into more complex secondary\nstructures that form when bonding occurs between amino acids with different properties at different regions of the\npolypeptide. The most common secondary structure is a spiral called an alpha-helix. If you were to take a length of\nstring and simply twist it into a spiral, it would not hold the shape. Similarly, a strand of amino acids could not\nmaintain a stable spiral shape without the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions\nof the same strand (see Figure 2.26b). Less commonly, a polypeptide chain can form a beta-pleated sheet, in which\nhydrogen bonds form bridges between different regions of a single polypeptide that has folded back upon itself, or\nbetween two or more adjacent polypeptide chains.\nThe secondary structure of proteins further folds into a compact three-dimensional shape, referred to as the\nprotein’s tertiary structure (see Figure 2.26c). In this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the\nprimary chain can be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds.\nA disulfide bond is a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide.

Where is the genetic code stored in a cell?,"['This nuclear envelope is studded with protein-\nlined pores that allow materials to be trafficked into\nand out of the nucleus. The nucleus contains one or\nmore nucleoli, which serve as sites for ribosome\nsynthesis. The nucleus houses the genetic material of\nthe cell: DNA. DNA is normally found as a loosely\ncontained structure called chromatin within the\nnucleus, where it is wound up and associated with a\nvariety of histone proteins. When a cell is about to\ndivide, the chromatin coils tightly and condenses to\nform chromosomes.\nThere is a pool of cells constantly dividing within your\nbody. The result is billions of new cells being created\neach day. Before any cell is ready to divide, it must\nreplicate its DNA so that each new daughter cell will\nreceive an exact copy of the organism’s genome. A\nvariety of enzymes are enlisted during DNA replication.\nThese enzymes unwind the DNA molecule, separate\nthe two strands, and assist with the building of\ncomplementary strands along each parent strand. The\noriginal DNA strands serve as templates from which\nthe nucleotide sequence of the new strands are\ndetermined and synthesized. When replication is\ncompleted, two identical DNA molecules exist. Each\none contains one original strand and one newly\nsynthesized complementary strand.\n3.4 Protein Synthesis\nDNA stores the information necessary for instructing\nthe cell to perform all of its functions. Cells use the\ngenetic code stored within DNA to build proteins,\nwhich ultimately determine the structure and function\nof the cell. This genetic code lies in the particular\nsequence of nucleotides that make up each gene along\nthe DNA molecule. To “read” this code, the cell must\nperform two sequential steps. In the first step,\ntranscription, the DNA code is converted into an RNA\ncode. A molecule of messenger RNA that is\ncomplementary to a specific gene is synthesized in a\nprocess similar to DNA replication. The molecule of\nmRNA provides the code to synthesize a protein. In the\nprocess of translation, the mRNA attaches to a\nribosome. Next, tRNA molecules shuttle the\nappropriate amino acids to the ribosome, one-by-one,\ncoded by sequential triplet codons on the mRNA, until\nthe protein is fully synthesized.', 'For example, the DNA triplet CAC (cytosine, adenine, and cytosine) specifies the\namino acid valine. Therefore, a gene, which is composed of multiple triplets in a unique sequence, provides the code\nto build an entire protein, with multiple amino acids in the proper sequence (Figure 3.25). The mechanism by which\ncells turn the DNA code into a protein product is a two-step process, with an RNA molecule as the intermediate.\nFIGURE 3.25\nThe Genetic Code\nDNA holds all of the genetic information necessary to build a cell’s proteins. The nucleotide sequence\nof a gene is ultimately translated into an amino acid sequence of the gene’s corresponding protein.\nFrom DNA to RNA: Transcription\nDNA is housed within the nucleus, and protein synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm, thus there must be some sort\nof intermediate messenger that leaves the nucleus and manages protein synthesis. This intermediate messenger is\nmessenger RNA (mRNA), a single-stranded nucleic acid that carries a copy of the genetic code for a single gene out\nof the nucleus and into the cytoplasm where it is used to produce proteins.\nThere are several different types of RNA, each having different functions in the cell. The structure of RNA is similar\nto DNA with a few small exceptions. For one thing, unlike DNA, most types of RNA, including mRNA, are single-\nstranded and contain no complementary strand. Second, the ribose sugar in RNA contains an additional oxygen\n3.4 • Protein Synthesis\n103\natom compared with DNA. Finally, instead of the base thymine, RNA contains the base uracil. This means that\nadenine will always pair up with uracil during the protein synthesis process.\nGene expression begins with the process called transcription, which is the synthesis of a strand of mRNA that is\ncomplementary to the gene of interest. This process is called transcription because the mRNA is like a transcript, or\ncopy, of the gene’s DNA code. Transcription begins in a fashion somewhat like DNA replication, in that a region of\nDNA unwinds and the two strands separate, however, only that small portion of the DNA will be split apart. The\ntriplets within the gene on this section of the DNA molecule are used as the template to transcribe the\ncomplementary strand of RNA (Figure 3.26).', 'Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a ribose-containing nucleotide that helps manifest the genetic\ncode as protein. RNA contains ribose, one phosphate group, and one nitrogen-containing base, but the “choices” of\nbase for RNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil.\nThe nitrogen-containing bases adenine and guanine are classified as purines. A purine is a nitrogen-containing\nmolecule with a double ring structure, which accommodates several nitrogen atoms. The bases cytosine, thymine\n(found in DNA only) and uracil (found in RNA only) are pyramidines. A pyramidine is a nitrogen-containing base with\n72\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\na single ring structure\nBonds formed by dehydration synthesis between the pentose sugar of one nucleic acid monomer and the phosphate\ngroup of another form a “backbone,” from which the components’ nitrogen-containing bases protrude. In DNA, two\nsuch backbones attach at their protruding bases via hydrogen bonds. These twist to form a shape known as a\ndouble helix (Figure 2.29). The sequence of nitrogen-containing bases within a strand of DNA form the genes that\nact as a molecular code instructing cells in the assembly of amino acids into proteins. Humans have almost 22,000\ngenes in their DNA, locked up in the 46 chromosomes inside the nucleus of each cell (except red blood cells which\nlose their nuclei during development). These genes carry the genetic code to build one’s body, and are unique for\neach individual except identical twins.\nFIGURE 2.29\nDNA\nIn the DNA double helix, two strands attach via hydrogen bonds between the bases of the component nucleotides.\nIn contrast, RNA consists of a single strand of sugar-phosphate backbone studded with bases. Messenger RNA\n(mRNA) is created during protein synthesis to carry the genetic instructions from the DNA to the cell’s protein\nmanufacturing plants in the cytoplasm, the ribosomes.\nAdenosine Triphosphate\nThe nucleotide adenosine triphosphate (ATP), is composed of a ribose sugar, an adenine base, and three phosphate\ngroups (Figure 2.30).', 'This refers to the fact\nthat DNA contains the information necessary for the cell to build one very important type of molecule: the protein.\nMost structural components of the cell are made up, at least in part, by proteins and virtually all the functions that a\ncell carries out are completed with the help of proteins. One of the most important classes of proteins is enzymes,\nwhich help speed up necessary biochemical reactions that take place inside the cell. Some of these critical\nbiochemical reactions include building larger molecules from smaller components (such as occurs during DNA\nreplication or synthesis of microtubules) and breaking down larger molecules into smaller components (such as\nwhen harvesting chemical energy from nutrient molecules). Whatever the cellular process may be, it is almost sure\nto involve proteins. Just as the cell’s genome describes its full complement of DNA, a cell’s proteome is its full\ncomplement of proteins. Protein synthesis begins with genes. A gene is a functional segment of DNA that provides\nthe genetic information necessary to build a protein. Each particular gene provides the code necessary to construct\na particular protein. Gene expression, which transforms the information coded in a gene to a final gene product,\nultimately dictates the structure and function of a cell by determining which proteins are made.\nThe interpretation of genes works in the following way. Recall that proteins are polymers, or chains, of many amino\nacid building blocks. The sequence of bases in a gene (that is, its sequence of A, T, C, G nucleotides) translates to an\namino acid sequence. A triplet is a section of three DNA bases in a row that codes for a specific amino acid. Similar\nto the way in which the three-letter code d-o-g signals the image of a dog, the three-letter DNA base code signals\nthe use of a particular amino acid. For example, the DNA triplet CAC (cytosine, adenine, and cytosine) specifies the\namino acid valine. Therefore, a gene, which is composed of multiple triplets in a unique sequence, provides the code\nto build an entire protein, with multiple amino acids in the proper sequence (Figure 3.25). The mechanism by which\ncells turn the DNA code into a protein product is a two-step process, with an RNA molecule as the intermediate.', 'Each new DNA molecule contains one strand from the original molecule and one newly synthesized strand. The term\nfor this mode of replication is “semiconservative,” because half of the original DNA molecule is conserved in each\nnew DNA molecule. This process continues until the cell’s entire genome, the entire complement of an organism’s\nDNA, is replicated. As you might imagine, it is very important that DNA replication take place precisely so that new\ncells in the body contain the exact same genetic material as their parent cells. Mistakes made during DNA\nreplication, such as the accidental addition of an inappropriate nucleotide, have the potential to render a gene\ndysfunctional or useless. Fortunately, there are mechanisms in place to minimize such mistakes. A DNA\nproofreading process enlists the help of special enzymes that scan the newly synthesized molecule for mistakes and\ncorrects them. Once the process of DNA replication is complete, the cell is ready to divide. You will explore the\nprocess of cell division later in the chapter.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/DNArep) to learn about DNA replication.

A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,\nclosed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body\nso that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to\nthe body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing\nsome of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.\nThe dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the\npressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body\ntissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the\npulsating flow of pressurized blood.\n1.5 Homeostasis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning\n•\nContrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism\nMaintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body\ntemperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point.\nA set point is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set\nof values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is\napproximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to\nfluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a).', 'The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human\nurine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n59\nFIGURE 2.17\nThe pH Scale\nBuffers\nThe pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this\nslightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into\nthe bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids.', 'For example, a cell that should be programmed to self-destruct (a process called apoptosis) due to extensive\nDNA damage might instead be triggered to proliferate by an oncoprotein. On the other hand, a dysfunctional tumor\nsuppressor gene may fail to provide the cell with a necessary stop signal, also resulting in unwanted cell division and\nproliferation.\nA delicate homeostatic balance between the many proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes delicately\ncontrols the cell cycle and ensures that only healthy cells replicate. Therefore, a disruption of this homeostatic\nbalance can cause aberrant cell division and cancerous growths.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nVisit this link (http://openstax.org/l/mitosis) to learn about mitosis.

Kidney failure,\nliver failure, heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.\nIn contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic). As with\nacidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low.\nLung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the\nnormal concentration of H+.\nMetabolic alkalosis often results from prolonged, severe vomiting, which causes a loss of hydrogen and chloride ions\n(as components of HCl).

Carbon atoms do not complete their valence shells by donating or\naccepting four electrons. Instead, they readily share electrons via covalent bonds.\nCommonly, carbon atoms share with other carbon atoms, often forming a long carbon chain referred to as a carbon\nskeleton. When they do share, however, they do not share all their electrons exclusively with each other. Rather,\ncarbon atoms tend to share electrons with a variety of other elements, one of which is always hydrogen. Carbon and\nhydrogen groupings are called hydrocarbons. If you study the figures of organic compounds in the remainder of this\nchapter, you will see several with chains of hydrocarbons in one region of the compound.\nMany combinations are possible to fill carbon’s four “vacancies.” Carbon may share electrons with oxygen or\nnitrogen or other atoms in a particular region of an organic compound.

This section of the chapter narrows the focus to the chemistry of human life; that is, the\ncompounds important for the body’s structure and function.

Organic compounds are covered later in the chapter.\nWater\nAs much as 70 percent of an adult’s body weight is water. This water is contained both within the cells and between\nthe cells that make up tissues and organs. Its several roles make water indispensable to human functioning.\nWater as a Lubricant and Cushion\nWater is a major component of many of the body’s lubricating fluids. Just as oil lubricates the hinge on a door, water\nin synovial fluid lubricates the actions of body joints, and water in pleural fluid helps the lungs expand and recoil\nwith breathing. Watery fluids help keep food flowing through the digestive tract, and ensure that the movement of\nadjacent abdominal organs is friction free.\nWater also protects cells and organs from physical trauma, cushioning the brain within the skull, for example, and\nprotecting the delicate nerve tissue of the eyes. Water cushions a developing fetus in the mother’s womb as well.\nWater as a Heat Sink\nA heat sink is a substance or object that absorbs and dissipates heat but does not experience a corresponding\nincrease in temperature. In the body, water absorbs the heat generated by chemical reactions without greatly\nincreasing in temperature. Moreover, when the environmental temperature soars, the water stored in the body helps\nkeep the body cool. This cooling effect happens as warm blood from the body’s core flows to the blood vessels just\nunder the skin and is transferred to the environment.

Where did the concept of a cell originate?,"['(b) In aqueous solution, a base dissociates into hydroxyl ions (OH–) and\ncations. Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–.\nBases\nA base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+ already present in\nsolution (see Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine\nwith H+ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+ and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases\nrelease most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H+. Food\nmixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract\nafter the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3–), a weak base that attracts H+. Bicarbonate\naccepts some of the H+ protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.\nThe Concept of pH\nThe relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution’s pH is the negative, base-10\nlogarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+\nconcentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times\nmore acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH.', 'Similar to the hair, nails grow continuously\nthroughout our lives.

Like next-door\nneighbors whose kids hang out first at one home and then at the other, the atoms do not lose or gain electrons\npermanently. Instead, the electrons move back and forth between the elements. Because of the close sharing of\npairs of electrons (one electron from each of two atoms), covalent bonds are stronger than ionic bonds.\nNonpolar Covalent Bonds\nFigure 2.9 shows several common types of covalent bonds. Notice that the two covalently bonded atoms typically\nshare just one or two electron pairs, though larger sharings are possible. The important concept to take from this is\nthat in covalent bonds, electrons in the two atoms' overlapping atomic orbitals are shared to fill the valence shells of\nboth atoms, ultimately stabilizing both of the atoms involved. In a single covalent bond, a single electron pair is\nshared between two atoms, while in a double covalent bond, two pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms.\nThere even are triple covalent bonds, where three electron pairs are shared between two atoms.\nFIGURE 2.9\nCovalent Bonding\nYou can see that the covalent bonds shown in Figure 2.9 are balanced. The sharing of the negative electrons is\nrelatively equal, as is the electrical pull of the positive protons in the nucleus of the atoms involved. This is why\ncovalently bonded molecules that are electrically balanced in this way are described as nonpolar; that is, no region\nof the molecule is either more positive or more negative than any other.\nPolar Covalent Bonds\nGroups of legislators with completely opposite views on a particular issue are often described as “polarized” by\nnews writers. In chemistry, a polar molecule is a molecule that contains regions that have opposite electrical\ncharges. Polar molecules occur when atoms share electrons unequally, in polar covalent bonds.\n2.2 • Chemical Bonds\n49\nThe most familiar example of a polar molecule is water (Figure 2.10)."", '(credit: “Mortadelo2005”/Wikimedia Commons)\nintroduced to the various types of cells in the body.\nA primary responsibility of each cell is to contribute to homeostasis. Homeostasis is a term used in biology that\nrefers to a dynamic state of balance within parameters that are compatible with life. For example, living cells require\na water-based environment to survive in, and there are various physical (anatomical) and physiological mechanisms\nthat keep all of the trillions of living cells in the human body moist. This is one aspect of homeostasis. When a\nparticular parameter, such as blood pressure or blood oxygen content, moves far enough out of homeostasis\n(generally becoming too high or too low), illness or disease—and sometimes death—inevitably results.\nThe concept of a cell started with microscopic observations of dead cork tissue by scientist Robert Hooke in 1665.\nWithout realizing their function or importance, Hook coined the term “cell” based on the resemblance of the small\nsubdivisions in the cork to the rooms that monks inhabited, called cells. About ten years later, Antonie van\nLeeuwenhoek became the first person to observe living and moving cells under a microscope.

Each copy of the chromosome is referred to as a sister\nchromatid and is physically bound to the other copy.(Note that the term ""sister chromatid"" is used regardless of the\nsex of the person.) The centromere is the structure that attaches one sister chromatid to another. Because a human\ncell has 46 chromosomes, during this phase, there are 92 chromatids (46 × 2) in the cell. Make sure not to confuse\nthe concept of a pair of chromatids (one chromosome and its exact copy attached during mitosis) and a homologous\npair of chromosomes (two paired chromosomes which were inherited separately, one from each parent) (Figure\n3.31).\n108\n3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 3.31\nA Homologous Pair of Chromosomes with their Attached Sister Chromatids\nThe red and blue colors correspond to a\nhomologous pair of chromosomes.

During this phase, a cell undergoes two major\nprocesses. First, it completes mitosis, during which the contents of the nucleus are equitably pulled apart and\ndistributed between its two halves. Cytokinesis then occurs, dividing the cytoplasm and cell body into two new cells.\nMitosis is divided into four major stages that take place after interphase (Figure 3.32) and in the following order:\nprophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.

Adherens junctions use either cadherins or integrins depending on whether\nthey are linking to other cells or matrix. The junctions are characterized by the presence of the contractile protein\nactin located on the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. The actin can connect isolated patches or form a\nbelt-like structure inside the cell. These junctions influence the shape and folding of the epithelial tissue.\nIn contrast with the tight and anchoring junctions, a gap junction forms an intercellular passageway between the\n132\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nmembranes of adjacent cells to facilitate the movement of small molecules and ions between the cytoplasm of\nadjacent cells. These junctions allow electrical and metabolic coupling of adjacent cells, which coordinates function\nin large groups of cells.\nClassification of Epithelial Tissues\nEpithelial tissues are classified according to the shape of the cells and number of the cell layers formed (Figure 4.6).\nCell shapes can be squamous (flattened and thin), cuboidal (boxy, as wide as it is tall), or columnar (rectangular,\ntaller than it is wide). Similarly, the number of cell layers in the tissue can be one—where every cell rests on the\nbasal lamina—which is a simple epithelium, or more than one, which is a stratified epithelium and only the basal\nlayer of cells rests on the basal lamina. Pseudostratified (pseudo- = “false”) describes tissue with a single layer of\nirregularly shaped cells that give the appearance of more than one layer.

Neither of these examples requires any energy\non the part of the cell, and therefore they use passive transport to move across the membrane.\nBefore moving on, you need to review the gases that can diffuse across a cell membrane. Because cells rapidly use\nup oxygen during metabolism, there is typically a lower concentration of O2 inside the cell than outside. As a result,\noxygen will diffuse from the interstitial fluid directly through the lipid bilayer of the membrane and into the\ncytoplasm within the cell. On the other hand, because cells produce CO2 as a byproduct of metabolism, CO2\nconcentrations rise within the cytoplasm; therefore, CO2 will move from the cell through the lipid bilayer and into the\ninterstitial fluid, where its concentration is lower. This mechanism of molecules moving across a cell membrane\nfrom the side where they are more concentrated to the side where they are less concentrated is a form of passive\ntransport called simple diffusion (Figure 3.5).\nFIGURE 3.5\nSimple Diffusion across the Cell (Plasma) Membrane\nThe structure of the lipid bilayer allows small, uncharged\nsubstances such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, and hydrophobic molecules such as lipids, to pass through the cell membrane, down their\nconcentration gradient, by simple diffusion.\nLarge polar or ionic molecules, which are hydrophilic, cannot easily cross the phospholipid bilayer. Very small polar\nmolecules, such as water, can cross via simple diffusion due to their small size. Charged atoms or molecules of any\nsize cannot cross the cell membrane via simple diffusion as the charges are repelled by the hydrophobic tails in the\ninterior of the phospholipid bilayer. Solutes dissolved in water on either side of the cell membrane will tend to\n3.1 • The Cell Membrane\n85\ndiffuse down their concentration gradients, but because most substances cannot pass freely through the lipid\nbilayer of the cell membrane, their movement is restricted to protein channels and specialized transport\nmechanisms in the membrane.', 'In simple columnar epithelium, the nucleus of the tall column-like cells tends to be elongated and located in the\nbasal end of the cells.

In the case of the cell membrane, only relatively small, nonpolar materials can move through the\nlipid bilayer (remember, the lipid tails of the membrane are nonpolar). Some examples of these are other lipids,\noxygen and carbon dioxide gases, and alcohol. However, water-soluble materials—like glucose, amino acids, and\nelectrolytes—need some assistance to cross the membrane because they are repelled by the hydrophobic tails of\nthe phospholipid bilayer. All substances that move through the membrane do so by one of two general methods,\nwhich are categorized based on whether or not energy is required. Passive transport is the movement of\n84\n3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nsubstances across the membrane without the expenditure of cellular energy. In contrast, active transport is the\nmovement of substances across the membrane using energy from adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\nPassive Transport\nIn order to understand how substances move passively across a cell membrane, it is necessary to understand\nconcentration gradients and diffusion. A concentration gradient is the difference in concentration of a substance\nacross a space. Molecules (or ions) will spread/diffuse from where they are more concentrated to where they are\nless concentrated until they are equally distributed in that space. (When molecules move in this way, they are said to\nmove down their concentration gradient.) Diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of higher\nconcentration to an area of lower concentration. A couple of common examples will help to illustrate this concept.\nImagine being inside a closed bathroom.', 'O2 generally diffuses into cells because it is more concentrated outside of them, and CO2 typically\ndiffuses out of cells because it is more concentrated inside of them. Neither of these examples requires any energy\non the part of the cell, and therefore they use passive transport to move across the membrane.\nBefore moving on, you need to review the gases that can diffuse across a cell membrane. Because cells rapidly use\nup oxygen during metabolism, there is typically a lower concentration of O2 inside the cell than outside. As a result,\noxygen will diffuse from the interstitial fluid directly through the lipid bilayer of the membrane and into the\ncytoplasm within the cell. On the other hand, because cells produce CO2 as a byproduct of metabolism, CO2\nconcentrations rise within the cytoplasm; therefore, CO2 will move from the cell through the lipid bilayer and into the\ninterstitial fluid, where its concentration is lower. This mechanism of molecules moving across a cell membrane\nfrom the side where they are more concentrated to the side where they are less concentrated is a form of passive\ntransport called simple diffusion (Figure 3.5).\nFIGURE 3.5\nSimple Diffusion across the Cell (Plasma) Membrane\nThe structure of the lipid bilayer allows small, uncharged\nsubstances such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, and hydrophobic molecules such as lipids, to pass through the cell membrane, down their\nconcentration gradient, by simple diffusion.\nLarge polar or ionic molecules, which are hydrophilic, cannot easily cross the phospholipid bilayer. Very small polar\nmolecules, such as water, can cross via simple diffusion due to their small size. Charged atoms or molecules of any\nsize cannot cross the cell membrane via simple diffusion as the charges are repelled by the hydrophobic tails in the\ninterior of the phospholipid bilayer. Solutes dissolved in water on either side of the cell membrane will tend to\n3.1 • The Cell Membrane\n85\ndiffuse down their concentration gradients, but because most substances cannot pass freely through the lipid\nbilayer of the cell membrane, their movement is restricted to protein channels and specialized transport\nmechanisms in the membrane.', 'A concentration gradient is the difference in concentration of a substance\nacross a space.

A couple of common examples will help to illustrate this concept.\nImagine being inside a closed bathroom. If a bottle of perfume were sprayed, the scent molecules would naturally\ndiffuse from the spot where they left the bottle to all corners of the bathroom, and this diffusion would go on until no\nmore concentration gradient remains. Another example is a spoonful of sugar placed in a cup of tea. Eventually the\nsugar will diffuse throughout the tea until no concentration gradient remains. In both cases, if the room is warmer or\nthe tea hotter, diffusion occurs even faster as the molecules are bumping into each other and spreading out faster\nthan at cooler temperatures. Having an internal body temperature around 98.6° F thus also aids in diffusion of\nparticles within the body.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nVisit this link (http://openstax.org/l/diffusion) to see diffusion and how it is propelled by the kinetic energy of\nmolecules in solution. How does temperature affect diffusion rate, and why?\nWhenever a substance exists in greater concentration on one side of a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell\nmembranes, any substance that can move down its concentration gradient across the membrane will do so.\nConsider substances that can easily diffuse through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, such as the gases oxygen\n(O2) and CO2. O2 generally diffuses into cells because it is more concentrated outside of them, and CO2 typically\ndiffuses out of cells because it is more concentrated inside of them.

Telomeres, regions of\nthe chromosomes necessary for cell division, shorten each time cells divide. As they do, cells are less able to divide\nand regenerate.

What is the process of a cell exporting material using vesicular transport?,"['FIGURE 3.10\nThree Forms of Endocytosis\nEndocytosis is a form of active transport in which a cell envelopes extracellular materials\nusing its cell membrane. (a) In phagocytosis, which is relatively nonselective, the cell takes in a large particle. (b) In pinocytosis, the cell\ntakes in small particles in fluid. (c) In contrast, receptor-mediated endocytosis is quite selective. When external receptors bind a specific\nligand, the cell responds by endocytosing the ligand.\nPhagocytosis and pinocytosis take in large portions of extracellular material, and they are typically not highly\nselective in the substances they bring in. Cells regulate the endocytosis of specific substances via receptor-\nmediated endocytosis. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is endocytosis by a portion of the cell membrane that\ncontains many receptors that are specific for a certain substance. Once the surface receptors have bound sufficient\namounts of the specific substance (the receptor’s ligand), the cell will endocytose the part of the cell membrane\ncontaining the receptor-ligand complexes. Iron, a required component of hemoglobin, is endocytosed by red blood\ncells in this way. Iron is bound to a protein called transferrin in the blood. Specific transferrin receptors on red blood\ncell surfaces bind the iron-transferrin molecules, and the cell endocytoses the receptor-ligand complexes.\nIn contrast with endocytosis, exocytosis (taking “out of the cell”) is the process of a cell exporting material using\nvesicular transport (Figure 3.11). Many cells manufacture substances that must be secreted, like a factory\nmanufacturing a product for export. These substances are typically packaged into membrane-bound vesicles within\nthe cell. When the vesicle membrane fuses with the cell membrane, the vesicle releases it contents into the\ninterstitial fluid. The vesicle membrane then becomes part of the cell membrane. Cells of the stomach and pancreas\nproduce and secrete digestive enzymes through exocytosis (Figure 3.12).', '1 The Cell Membrane\nThe cell membrane provides a barrier around the cell,\nseparating its internal components from the\nextracellular environment. It is composed of a\nphospholipid bilayer, with hydrophobic internal lipid\n“tails” and hydrophilic external phosphate “heads.”\nVarious membrane proteins are scattered throughout\nthe bilayer, both inserted within it and attached to it\nperipherally. The cell membrane is selectively\npermeable, allowing only a limited number of materials\nto diffuse through its lipid bilayer. All materials that\ncross the membrane do so using passive (non energy-\nrequiring) or active (energy-requiring) transport\nprocesses. During passive transport, materials move by\nsimple diffusion or by facilitated diffusion through the\nmembrane, down their concentration gradient. Water\n118\n3 • Chapter Review\nAccess for free at openstax.org\npasses through the membrane in a diffusion process\ncalled osmosis. During active transport, energy is\nexpended to assist material movement across the\nmembrane in a direction against their concentration\ngradient. Active transport may take place with the help\nof protein pumps or through the use of vesicles.\n3.2 The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles\nThe internal environmental of a living cell is made up of\na fluid, jelly-like substance called cytosol, which\nconsists mainly of water, but also contains various\ndissolved nutrients and other molecules. The cell\ncontains an array of cellular organelles, each one\nperforming a unique function and helping to maintain\nthe health and activity of the cell. The cytosol and\norganelles together compose the cell’s cytoplasm.\nMost organelles are surrounded by a lipid membrane\nsimilar to the cell membrane of the cell. The\nendoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and\nlysosomes share a functional connectivity and are\ncollectively referred to as the endomembrane system.\nThere are two types of ER: smooth and rough. While\nthe smooth ER performs many functions, including lipid\nsynthesis and ion storage, the rough ER is mainly\nresponsible for protein synthesis using its associated\nribosomes. The rough ER sends newly made proteins\nto the Golgi apparatus where they are modified and\npackaged for delivery to various locations within or\noutside of the cell.', ""The flood of\nsodium ions through the symporter provides the energy that allows glucose to move through the symporter and into\nthe cell, against its concentration gradient.\nConversely, antiporters are secondary active transport systems that transport substances in opposite directions. For\nexample, the sodium-hydrogen ion antiporter uses the energy from the inward flood of sodium ions to move\nhydrogen ions (H+) out of the cell. The sodium-hydrogen antiporter is used to maintain the pH of the cell's interior.\nOther forms of active transport do not involve membrane carriers. Endocytosis (bringing “into the cell”) is the\nprocess of a cell ingesting material by enveloping it in a portion of its cell membrane, and then pinching off that\nportion of membrane (Figure 3.10). Once pinched off, the portion of membrane and its contents becomes an\nindependent, intracellular vesicle. A vesicle is a membranous sac—a spherical and hollow organelle bounded by a\nlipid bilayer membrane. Endocytosis often brings materials into the cell that must be broken down or digested.\n88\n3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nPhagocytosis (“cell eating”) is the endocytosis of large particles.

Mucous, sweat, saliva, and\nbreast milk are all examples of secretions from exocrine glands. They are all discharged through tubular ducts.\nSecretions into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, technically outside of the body, are of the exocrine category.\nGlandular Structure\nExocrine glands are classified as either unicellular or multicellular. The unicellular glands are scattered single cells,\nsuch as goblet cells, found in the mucous membranes of the small and large intestine.\nThe multicellular exocrine glands known as serous glands develop from simple epithelium to form a secretory\nsurface that secretes directly into an inner cavity. These glands line the internal cavities of the abdomen and chest\nand release their secretions directly into the cavities. Other multicellular exocrine glands release their contents\nthrough a tubular duct. The duct is single in a simple gland but in compound glands is divided into one or more\nbranches (Figure 4.9). In tubular glands, the ducts can be straight or coiled, whereas tubes that form pockets are\nalveolar (acinar), such as the exocrine portion of the pancreas. Combinations of tubes and pockets are known as\ntubuloalveolar (tubuloacinar) compound glands.

Where are hepatocytes located?,"['Another important function of\nthe cell is detoxification. Humans take in all sorts of toxins from the environment and also produce harmful\nchemicals as byproducts of cellular processes. Cells called hepatocytes in the liver detoxify many of these toxins.\nMitochondria\nA mitochondrion (plural = mitochondria) is a membranous, bean-shaped organelle that is the “energy transformer”\nof the cell. Mitochondria consist of an outer lipid bilayer membrane as well as an additional inner lipid bilayer\nmembrane (Figure 3.16). The inner membrane is highly folded into winding structures with a great deal of surface\narea, called cristae. It is along this inner membrane that a series of proteins, enzymes, and other molecules perform\nthe biochemical reactions of cellular respiration. These reactions convert energy stored in nutrient molecules (such\nas glucose) into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides usable cellular energy to the cell. Cells use ATP\nconstantly, and so the mitochondria are constantly at work. Oxygen molecules are required during cellular\nrespiration, which is why you must constantly breathe it in. One of the organ systems in the body that uses huge\namounts of ATP is the muscular system because ATP is required to sustain muscle contraction. As a result, muscle\ncells are packed full of mitochondria. Nerve cells also need large quantities of ATP to run their sodium-potassium\npumps. Therefore, an individual neuron will be loaded with over a thousand mitochondria. On the other hand, a bone\ncell, which is not nearly as metabolically-active, might only have a couple hundred mitochondria.\nFIGURE 3.16\nMitochondrion\nThe mitochondria are the energy-conversion factories of the cell.

A lysosome is an organelle that contains enzymes that break down and\ndigest unneeded cellular components, such as a damaged organelle.

Lysosomes are also important for breaking down foreign material. For example, when\ncertain immune defense cells (white blood cells) phagocytize bacteria, the bacterial cell is transported into a\nlysosome and digested by the enzymes inside. As one might imagine, such phagocytic defense cells contain large\nnumbers of lysosomes.\nUnder certain circumstances, lysosomes perform a more grand and dire function. In the case of damaged or\nunhealthy cells, lysosomes can be triggered to open up and release their digestive enzymes into the cytoplasm of\nthe cell, killing the cell. This “self-destruct” mechanism is called autolysis, and makes the process of cell death\ncontrolled (a mechanism called “apoptosis”).\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/endomembrane1) to learn about the endomembrane system, which includes\nthe rough and smooth ER and the Golgi body as well as lysosomes and vesicles.

The phospholipids are tightly packed\ntogether, and the membrane has a hydrophobic interior. This structure causes the membrane to be selectively\npermeable. A membrane that has selective permeability allows only substances meeting certain criteria to pass\nthrough it unaided. In the case of the cell membrane, only relatively small, nonpolar materials can move through the\nlipid bilayer (remember, the lipid tails of the membrane are nonpolar). Some examples of these are other lipids,\noxygen and carbon dioxide gases, and alcohol. However, water-soluble materials—like glucose, amino acids, and\nelectrolytes—need some assistance to cross the membrane because they are repelled by the hydrophobic tails of\nthe phospholipid bilayer. All substances that move through the membrane do so by one of two general methods,\nwhich are categorized based on whether or not energy is required. Passive transport is the movement of\n84\n3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nsubstances across the membrane without the expenditure of cellular energy. In contrast, active transport is the\nmovement of substances across the membrane using energy from adenosine triphosphate (ATP).\nPassive Transport\nIn order to understand how substances move passively across a cell membrane, it is necessary to understand\nconcentration gradients and diffusion. A concentration gradient is the difference in concentration of a substance\nacross a space. Molecules (or ions) will spread/diffuse from where they are more concentrated to where they are\nless concentrated until they are equally distributed in that space. (When molecules move in this way, they are said to\nmove down their concentration gradient.) Diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of higher\nconcentration to an area of lower concentration. A couple of common examples will help to illustrate this concept.\nImagine being inside a closed bathroom.', 'A concentration gradient is the difference in concentration of a substance\nacross a space. Molecules (or ions) will spread/diffuse from where they are more concentrated to where they are\nless concentrated until they are equally distributed in that space. (When molecules move in this way, they are said to\nmove down their concentration gradient.) Diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of higher\nconcentration to an area of lower concentration. A couple of common examples will help to illustrate this concept.\nImagine being inside a closed bathroom. If a bottle of perfume were sprayed, the scent molecules would naturally\ndiffuse from the spot where they left the bottle to all corners of the bathroom, and this diffusion would go on until no\nmore concentration gradient remains. Another example is a spoonful of sugar placed in a cup of tea. Eventually the\nsugar will diffuse throughout the tea until no concentration gradient remains. In both cases, if the room is warmer or\nthe tea hotter, diffusion occurs even faster as the molecules are bumping into each other and spreading out faster\nthan at cooler temperatures. Having an internal body temperature around 98.6° F thus also aids in diffusion of\nparticles within the body.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nVisit this link (http://openstax.org/l/diffusion) to see diffusion and how it is propelled by the kinetic energy of\nmolecules in solution. How does temperature affect diffusion rate, and why?\nWhenever a substance exists in greater concentration on one side of a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell\nmembranes, any substance that can move down its concentration gradient across the membrane will do so.\nConsider substances that can easily diffuse through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, such as the gases oxygen\n(O2) and CO2. O2 generally diffuses into cells because it is more concentrated outside of them, and CO2 typically\ndiffuses out of cells because it is more concentrated inside of them. Neither of these examples requires any energy\non the part of the cell, and therefore they use passive transport to move across the membrane.\nBefore moving on, you need to review the gases that can diffuse across a cell membrane. Because cells rapidly use\nup oxygen during metabolism, there is typically a lower concentration of O2 inside the cell than outside.', 'O2 generally diffuses into cells because it is more concentrated outside of them, and CO2 typically\ndiffuses out of cells because it is more concentrated inside of them. Neither of these examples requires any energy\non the part of the cell, and therefore they use passive transport to move across the membrane.\nBefore moving on, you need to review the gases that can diffuse across a cell membrane. Because cells rapidly use\nup oxygen during metabolism, there is typically a lower concentration of O2 inside the cell than outside. As a result,\noxygen will diffuse from the interstitial fluid directly through the lipid bilayer of the membrane and into the\ncytoplasm within the cell. On the other hand, because cells produce CO2 as a byproduct of metabolism, CO2\nconcentrations rise within the cytoplasm; therefore, CO2 will move from the cell through the lipid bilayer and into the\ninterstitial fluid, where its concentration is lower. This mechanism of molecules moving across a cell membrane\nfrom the side where they are more concentrated to the side where they are less concentrated is a form of passive\ntransport called simple diffusion (Figure 3.5).\nFIGURE 3.5\nSimple Diffusion across the Cell (Plasma) Membrane\nThe structure of the lipid bilayer allows small, uncharged\nsubstances such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, and hydrophobic molecules such as lipids, to pass through the cell membrane, down their\nconcentration gradient, by simple diffusion.\nLarge polar or ionic molecules, which are hydrophilic, cannot easily cross the phospholipid bilayer. Very small polar\nmolecules, such as water, can cross via simple diffusion due to their small size. Charged atoms or molecules of any\nsize cannot cross the cell membrane via simple diffusion as the charges are repelled by the hydrophobic tails in the\ninterior of the phospholipid bilayer.

Two main classes of cells make up nervous tissue: the neuron and neuroglia\n(Figure 4.19).

What are the main parts of a nerve\ncell?\nNeurons display distinctive morphology, well suited to their role as conducting cells, with three main parts. The cell\nbody includes most of the cytoplasm, the organelles, and the nucleus. Dendrites branch off the cell body and appear\nas thin extensions. A long “tail,” the axon, extends from the neuron body and can be wrapped in an insulating layer\nknown as myelin, which is formed by accessory cells. The synapse is the gap between nerve cells, or between a\nnerve cell and its target, for example, a muscle or a gland, across which the impulse is transmitted by chemical\ncompounds known as neurotransmitters. Neurons categorized as multipolar neurons have several dendrites and a\nsingle prominent axon. Bipolar neurons possess a single dendrite and axon with the cell body, while unipolar\nneurons have only a single process extending out from the cell body, which divides into a functional dendrite and\ninto a functional axon. When a neuron is sufficiently stimulated, it generates an action potential that propagates\ndown the axon towards the synapse. If enough neurotransmitters are released at the synapse to stimulate the next\nneuron or target, a response is generated.\nThe second class of neural cells comprises the neuroglia or glial cells, which have been characterized as having a\nsimple support role. The word “glia” comes from the Greek word for glue. Recent research is shedding light on the\nmore complex role of neuroglia in the function of the brain and nervous system.

Each cell in your body (with the exception of germ cells) contains the complete\nset of your DNA.', 'If you zoom on the cells at the outermost layer of this section of skin, what do you notice about the cells?\nThe keratinocytes in the stratum spinosum begin the synthesis of keratin and release a water-repelling glycolipid\n166\n5 • The Integumentary System\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nthat helps prevent water loss from the body, making the skin relatively waterproof. As new keratinocytes are\nproduced atop the stratum basale, the keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum are pushed into the stratum\ngranulosum.\nStratum Granulosum\nThe stratum granulosum has a grainy appearance due to further changes to the keratinocytes as they are pushed\nfrom the stratum spinosum. The cells (three to five layers deep) become flatter, their cell membranes thicken, and\nthey generate large amounts of the proteins keratin, which is fibrous, and keratohyalin, which accumulates as\nlamellar granules within the cells (see Figure 5.5). These two proteins make up the bulk of the keratinocyte mass in\nthe stratum granulosum and give the layer its grainy appearance. The nuclei and other cell organelles disintegrate as\nthe cells die, leaving behind the keratin, keratohyalin, and cell membranes that will form the stratum lucidum, the\nstratum corneum, and the accessory structures of hair and nails.\nStratum Lucidum\nThe stratum lucidum is a smooth, seemingly translucent layer of the epidermis located just above the stratum\ngranulosum and below the stratum corneum. This thin layer of cells is found only in the thick skin of the palms,\nsoles, and digits. The keratinocytes that compose the stratum lucidum are dead and flattened (see Figure 5.5).\nThese cells are densely packed with eleidin, a clear protein, derived from keratohyalin, which gives these cells their\ntransparent (i.e., lucid) appearance.\nStratum Corneum\nThe stratum corneum is the most superficial layer of the epidermis and is the layer exposed to the outside\nenvironment (see Figure 5.5).', 'Transitional describes a form of specialized\nstratified epithelium in which the shape of the cells can vary.\nFIGURE 4.6\nCells of Epithelial Tissue\nSimple epithelial tissue is organized as a single layer of cells and stratified epithelial tissue is\nformed by several layers of cells.\nSimple Epithelium\nThe shape of the cells in the single cell layer of simple epithelium reflects the functioning of those cells. The cells in\nsimple squamous epithelium have the appearance of thin scales. Squamous cell nuclei tend to be flat, horizontal,\nand elliptical, mirroring the form of the cell. The endothelium is the epithelial tissue that lines vessels of the\nlymphatic and cardiovascular system, and it is made up of a single layer of squamous cells. Simple squamous\nepithelium, because of the thinness of the cell, is present where rapid passage of chemical compounds is observed.\nThe alveoli of lungs where gases diffuse, segments of kidney tubules, and the lining of capillaries are also made of\nsimple squamous epithelial tissue. The mesothelium is a simple squamous epithelium that forms the surface layer\nof the serous membrane that lines body cavities and internal organs. Its primary function is to provide a smooth and\nprotective surface. Mesothelial cells are squamous epithelial cells that secrete a fluid that lubricates the\nmesothelium.\nIn simple cuboidal epithelium, the nucleus of the box-like cells appears round and is generally located near the\ncenter of the cell. These epithelia are active in the secretion and absorptions of molecules. Simple cuboidal epithelia\n4.2 • Epithelial Tissue\n133\nare observed in the lining of the kidney tubules and in the ducts of glands.\nIn simple columnar epithelium, the nucleus of the tall column-like cells tends to be elongated and located in the\nbasal end of the cells. Like the cuboidal epithelia, this epithelium is active in the absorption and secretion of\nmolecules. Simple columnar epithelium forms the lining of some sections of the digestive system and parts of the\nfemale reproductive tract.

Ciliated columnar epithelium is composed of simple columnar epithelial cells with cilia on\ntheir apical surfaces. These epithelial cells are found in the lining of the fallopian tubes and parts of the respiratory\nsystem, where the beating of the cilia helps remove particulate matter.\nPseudostratified columnar epithelium is a type of epithelium that appears to be stratified but instead consists of a\nsingle layer of irregularly shaped and differently sized columnar cells. In pseudostratified epithelium, nuclei of\nneighboring cells appear at different levels rather than clustered in the basal end. The arrangement gives the\nappearance of stratification; but in fact all the cells are in contact with the basal lamina, although some do not reach\nthe apical surface. Pseudostratified columnar epithelium is found in the respiratory tract, where some of these cells\nhave cilia.\nBoth simple and pseudostratified columnar epithelia are heterogeneous epithelia because they include additional\ntypes of cells interspersed among the epithelial cells.

What is the intermediate messenger that leaves the nucleus and manages protein synthesis?,"['For example, the DNA triplet CAC (cytosine, adenine, and cytosine) specifies the\namino acid valine. Therefore, a gene, which is composed of multiple triplets in a unique sequence, provides the code\nto build an entire protein, with multiple amino acids in the proper sequence (Figure 3.25). The mechanism by which\ncells turn the DNA code into a protein product is a two-step process, with an RNA molecule as the intermediate.\nFIGURE 3.25\nThe Genetic Code\nDNA holds all of the genetic information necessary to build a cell’s proteins. The nucleotide sequence\nof a gene is ultimately translated into an amino acid sequence of the gene’s corresponding protein.\nFrom DNA to RNA: Transcription\nDNA is housed within the nucleus, and protein synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm, thus there must be some sort\nof intermediate messenger that leaves the nucleus and manages protein synthesis. This intermediate messenger is\nmessenger RNA (mRNA), a single-stranded nucleic acid that carries a copy of the genetic code for a single gene out\nof the nucleus and into the cytoplasm where it is used to produce proteins.\nThere are several different types of RNA, each having different functions in the cell. The structure of RNA is similar\nto DNA with a few small exceptions. For one thing, unlike DNA, most types of RNA, including mRNA, are single-\nstranded and contain no complementary strand. Second, the ribose sugar in RNA contains an additional oxygen\n3.4 • Protein Synthesis\n103\natom compared with DNA. Finally, instead of the base thymine, RNA contains the base uracil. This means that\nadenine will always pair up with uracil during the protein synthesis process.\nGene expression begins with the process called transcription, which is the synthesis of a strand of mRNA that is\ncomplementary to the gene of interest. This process is called transcription because the mRNA is like a transcript, or\ncopy, of the gene’s DNA code. Transcription begins in a fashion somewhat like DNA replication, in that a region of\nDNA unwinds and the two strands separate, however, only that small portion of the DNA will be split apart.

As its name would suggest, an intermediate filament is\na filament intermediate in thickness between the microtubules and microfilaments (see Figure 3.18c). Intermediate\nfilaments are made up of long fibrous subunits of a protein called keratin that are wound together like the threads\nthat compose a rope. Intermediate filaments, in concert with the microtubules, are important for maintaining cell\nshape and structure. Unlike the microtubules, which resist compression, intermediate filaments resist tension—the\nforces that pull apart cells. There are many cases in which cells are prone to tension, such as when epithelial cells of\nthe skin are compressed, tugging them in different directions. Intermediate filaments help anchor organelles\ntogether within a cell and also link cells to other cells by forming special cell-to-cell junctions.\n3.3 The Nucleus and DNA Replication\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the structure and features of the nuclear membrane\n•\nList the contents of the nucleus\n•\nExplain the organization of the DNA molecule within the nucleus\n•\nDescribe the process of DNA replication\nThe nucleus is the largest and most prominent of a cell’s organelles (Figure 3.19).

Other cells, such as mammalian red blood cells (RBCs), do not contain nuclei at all. RBCs\neject their nuclei as they mature, making space for the large numbers of hemoglobin molecules that carry oxygen\nthroughout the body (Figure 3.21).

The cell membrane is selectively\npermeable, allowing only a limited number of materials\nto diffuse through its lipid bilayer. All materials that\ncross the membrane do so using passive (non energy-\nrequiring) or active (energy-requiring) transport\nprocesses.

During active transport, energy is\nexpended to assist material movement across the\nmembrane in a direction against their concentration\ngradient. Active transport may take place with the help\nof protein pumps or through the use of vesicles.\n3.2 The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles\nThe internal environmental of a living cell is made up of\na fluid, jelly-like substance called cytosol, which\nconsists mainly of water, but also contains various\ndissolved nutrients and other molecules. The cell\ncontains an array of cellular organelles, each one\nperforming a unique function and helping to maintain\nthe health and activity of the cell. The cytosol and\norganelles together compose the cell’s cytoplasm.\nMost organelles are surrounded by a lipid membrane\nsimilar to the cell membrane of the cell. The\nendoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and\nlysosomes share a functional connectivity and are\ncollectively referred to as the endomembrane system.\nThere are two types of ER: smooth and rough. While\nthe smooth ER performs many functions, including lipid\nsynthesis and ion storage, the rough ER is mainly\nresponsible for protein synthesis using its associated\nribosomes. The rough ER sends newly made proteins\nto the Golgi apparatus where they are modified and\npackaged for delivery to various locations within or\noutside of the cell.', 'Sulfur\ndoes not readily participate in hydrogen bonds, whereas all other amino acids do. This variation influences the way\nthat proteins containing cysteine and methionine are assembled.\nAmino acids join via dehydration synthesis to form protein polymers (Figure 2.25). The unique bond holding amino\nacids together is called a peptide bond. A peptide bond is a covalent bond between two amino acids that forms by\ndehydration synthesis. A peptide, in fact, is a very short chain of amino acids. Strands containing fewer than about\n100 amino acids are generally referred to as polypeptides rather than proteins.\nFIGURE 2.25\nPeptide Bond\nDifferent amino acids join together to form peptides, polypeptides, or proteins via dehydration synthesis.\nThe bonds between the amino acids are peptide bonds R1 and R2 may be the same or different side chains.\nThe body is able to synthesize most of the amino acids from components of other molecules; however, nine cannot\nbe synthesized and have to be consumed in the diet. These are known as the essential amino acids.\nFree amino acids available for protein construction are said to reside in the amino acid pool within cells. Structures\nwithin cells use these amino acids when assembling proteins. If a particular essential amino acid is not available in\nsufficient quantities in the amino acid pool, however, synthesis of proteins containing it can slow or even cease.\nShape of Proteins\nJust as a fork cannot be used to eat soup and a spoon cannot be used to spear meat, a protein’s shape is essential\nto its function. A protein’s shape is determined, most fundamentally, by the sequence of amino acids of which it is\nmade (Figure 2.26a). The sequence is called the primary structure of the protein.\n2.5 • Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n69\nFIGURE 2.26\nThe Shape of Proteins\n(a) The primary structure is the sequence of amino acids that make up the polypeptide chain.

What is the G0 phase of the cell cycle?,"['Cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm into two distinctive cells.\nInterphase\nA cell grows and carries out all normal metabolic functions and processes in a period called G1 (Figure 3.30). G1\nphase (gap 1 phase) is the first gap, or growth phase in the cell cycle. For cells that will divide again, G1 is followed\nby replication of the DNA, during the S phase. The S phase (synthesis phase) is period during which a cell replicates\nits DNA.\nFIGURE 3.30\nCell Cycle\nThe two major phases of the cell cycle include mitosis (designated M), when the cell divides, and interphase,\nwhen the cell grows and performs all of its normal functions. Interphase is further subdivided into G1, S, and G2 phases.\nAfter the synthesis phase, the cell proceeds through the G2 phase. The G2 phase is a second gap phase, during\nwhich the cell continues to grow and makes the necessary preparations for mitosis. Between G1, S, and G2 phases,\ncells will vary the most in their duration of the G1 phase. It is here that a cell might spend a couple of hours, or many\ndays. The S phase typically lasts between 8-10 hours and the G2 phase approximately 5 hours. In contrast to these\nphases, the G0 phase is a resting phase of the cell cycle. Cells that have temporarily stopped dividing and are resting\n(a common condition) and cells that have permanently ceased dividing (like nerve cells) are said to be in G0.\nThe Structure of Chromosomes\nBillions of cells in the human body divide every day. During the synthesis phase (S, for DNA synthesis) of interphase,\nthe amount of DNA within the cell precisely doubles. Therefore, after DNA replication but before cell division, each\ncell actually contains two copies of each chromosome.

A somatic cell is a general term for a body cell, and all\nhuman cells, except for the cells that produce eggs and sperm (which are referred to as germ cells), are somatic\ncells. Somatic cells contain two copies of each of their chromosomes (one copy received from each parent). A\nhomologous pair of chromosomes is the two copies of a single chromosome found in each somatic cell. The human\nis a diploid organism, having 23 homologous pairs of chromosomes in each of the somatic cells. The condition of\nhaving pairs of chromosomes is known as diploidy.\nCells in the body replace themselves over the lifetime of a person. For example, the cells lining the gastrointestinal\ntract must be frequently replaced when constantly “worn off” by the movement of food through the gut. But what\ntriggers a cell to divide, and how does it prepare for and complete cell division? The cell cycle is the sequence of\nevents in the life of the cell from the moment it is created at the end of a previous cycle of cell division until it then\ndivides itself, generating two new cells.\n3.5 • Cell Growth and Division\n107\nThe Cell Cycle\nOne “turn” or cycle of the cell cycle consists of two general phases: interphase, followed by mitosis and cytokinesis.\nInterphase is the period of the cell cycle during which the cell is not dividing. The majority of cells are in interphase\nmost of the time. Mitosis is the division of genetic material, during which the cell nucleus breaks down and two new,\nfully functional, nuclei are formed. Cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm into two distinctive cells.\nInterphase\nA cell grows and carries out all normal metabolic functions and processes in a period called G1 (Figure 3.30). G1\nphase (gap 1 phase) is the first gap, or growth phase in the cell cycle. For cells that will divide again, G1 is followed\nby replication of the DNA, during the S phase. The S phase (synthesis phase) is period during which a cell replicates\nits DNA.']","The G0 phase is a resting phase of the cell cycle where cells have temporarily stopped dividing or have permanently ceased dividing, such as nerve cells. It is typically entered from the G1 phase and can last for extended periods.","The G0 phase is a resting phase of the cell cycle, where cells that have temporarily stopped dividing and are resting, or cells that have permanently ceased dividing, such as nerve cells, are said to be in G0."

What are the main parts of a nerve\ncell?\nNeurons display distinctive morphology, well suited to their role as conducting cells, with three main parts. The cell\nbody includes most of the cytoplasm, the organelles, and the nucleus. Dendrites branch off the cell body and appear\nas thin extensions. A long “tail,” the axon, extends from the neuron body and can be wrapped in an insulating layer\nknown as myelin, which is formed by accessory cells. The synapse is the gap between nerve cells, or between a\nnerve cell and its target, for example, a muscle or a gland, across which the impulse is transmitted by chemical\ncompounds known as neurotransmitters. Neurons categorized as multipolar neurons have several dendrites and a\nsingle prominent axon. Bipolar neurons possess a single dendrite and axon with the cell body, while unipolar\nneurons have only a single process extending out from the cell body, which divides into a functional dendrite and\ninto a functional axon. When a neuron is sufficiently stimulated, it generates an action potential that propagates\ndown the axon towards the synapse. If enough neurotransmitters are released at the synapse to stimulate the next\nneuron or target, a response is generated.\nThe second class of neural cells comprises the neuroglia or glial cells, which have been characterized as having a\nsimple support role. The word “glia” comes from the Greek word for glue. Recent research is shedding light on the\nmore complex role of neuroglia in the function of the brain and nervous system. Astrocyte cells, named for their\ndistinctive star shape, are abundant in the central nervous system.

What is the role of tumor suppressor genes in a cell's 'cruise control system'?,"['Similarly, the cell includes molecular messengers, such as cyclins, that push the cell forward in its cycle.\nIn addition to cyclins, a class of proteins that are encoded by genes called proto-oncogenes provide important\nsignals that regulate the cell cycle and move it forward. Examples of proto-oncogene products include cell-surface\nreceptors for growth factors, or cell-signaling molecules, two classes of molecules that can promote DNA replication\nand cell division. In contrast, a second class of genes known as tumor suppressor genes sends stop signals during a\ncell cycle. For example, certain protein products of tumor suppressor genes signal potential problems with the DNA\nand thus stop the cell from dividing, while other proteins signal the cell to die if it is damaged beyond repair. Some\ntumor suppressor proteins also signal a sufficient surrounding cellular density, which indicates that the cell need not\npresently divide. The latter function is uniquely important in preventing tumor growth: normal cells exhibit a\nphenomenon called “contact inhibition;” thus, extensive cellular contact with neighboring cells causes a signal that\nstops further cell division.\nThese two contrasting classes of genes, proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, are like the accelerator and\nbrake pedal of the cell’s own “cruise control system,” respectively. Under normal conditions, these stop and go\nsignals are maintained in a homeostatic balance. Generally speaking, there are two ways that the cell’s cruise\ncontrol can lose control: a malfunctioning (overactive) accelerator, or a malfunctioning (underactive) brake. When\ncompromised through a mutation, or otherwise altered, proto-oncogenes can be converted to oncogenes, which\nproduce oncoproteins that push a cell forward in its cycle and stimulate cell division even when it is undesirable to\ndo so. For example, a cell that should be programmed to self-destruct (a process called apoptosis) due to extensive\nDNA damage might instead be triggered to proliferate by an oncoprotein. On the other hand, a dysfunctional tumor\nsuppressor gene may fail to provide the cell with a necessary stop signal, also resulting in unwanted cell division and\nproliferation.\nA delicate homeostatic balance between the many proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes delicately\ncontrols the cell cycle and ensures that only healthy cells replicate.', 'Environmental insult that damages DNA can also cause dysfunction in those signals. Often, a combination of\nboth genetic predisposition and environmental factors lead to cancer.\nThe process of a cell escaping its normal control system and becoming cancerous may actually happen throughout\nthe body quite frequently. Fortunately, certain cells of the immune system are capable of recognizing cells that have\nbecome cancerous and destroying them. However, in certain cases the cancerous cells remain undetected and\ncontinue to proliferate. If the resulting tumor does not pose a threat to surrounding tissues, it is said to be benign\nand can usually be easily removed. If capable of damage, the tumor is considered malignant and the patient is\ndiagnosed with cancer.\nHOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCES\nCancer Arises from Homeostatic Imbalances\nCancer is an extremely complex condition, capable of arising from a wide variety of genetic and environmental\ncauses. Typically, mutations or aberrations in a cell’s DNA that compromise normal cell cycle control systems lead\nto cancerous tumors. Cell cycle control is an example of a homeostatic mechanism that maintains proper cell\nfunction and health. While progressing through the phases of the cell cycle, a large variety of intracellular molecules\n3.5 • Cell Growth and Division\n111\nprovide stop and go signals to regulate movement forward to the next phase. These signals are maintained in an\nintricate balance so that the cell only proceeds to the next phase when it is ready. This homeostatic control of the\ncell cycle can be thought of like a car’s cruise control. Cruise control will continually apply just the right amount of\nacceleration to maintain a desired speed, unless the driver hits the brakes, in which case the car will slow down.\nSimilarly, the cell includes molecular messengers, such as cyclins, that push the cell forward in its cycle.\nIn addition to cyclins, a class of proteins that are encoded by genes called proto-oncogenes provide important\nsignals that regulate the cell cycle and move it forward.

On the other hand, a dysfunctional tumor\nsuppressor gene may fail to provide the cell with a necessary stop signal, also resulting in unwanted cell division and\nproliferation.\nA delicate homeostatic balance between the many proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes delicately\ncontrols the cell cycle and ensures that only healthy cells replicate.', 'For example, a cell that should be programmed to self-destruct (a process called apoptosis) due to extensive\nDNA damage might instead be triggered to proliferate by an oncoprotein.

Throughout\ndevelopment and adulthood, the process of cellular differentiation leads cells to assume their final morphology and\nphysiology. Differentiation is the process by which unspecialized cells become specialized to carry out distinct\nfunctions.\nStem Cells\nA stem cell is an unspecialized cell that can divide without limit as needed and can, under specific conditions,\ndifferentiate into specialized cells. Stem cells are divided into several categories according to their potential to\ndifferentiate.\n112\n3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe first embryonic cells that arise from the division of the zygote are the ultimate stem cells; these stems cells are\ndescribed as totipotent because they have the potential to differentiate into any of the cells needed to enable an\norganism to grow and develop.\nThe embryonic cells that develop from totipotent stem cells and are precursors to the fundamental tissue layers of\nthe embryo are classified as pluripotent.', 'Environmental insult that damages DNA can also cause dysfunction in those signals. Often, a combination of\nboth genetic predisposition and environmental factors lead to cancer.\nThe process of a cell escaping its normal control system and becoming cancerous may actually happen throughout\nthe body quite frequently. Fortunately, certain cells of the immune system are capable of recognizing cells that have\nbecome cancerous and destroying them. However, in certain cases the cancerous cells remain undetected and\ncontinue to proliferate. If the resulting tumor does not pose a threat to surrounding tissues, it is said to be benign\nand can usually be easily removed. If capable of damage, the tumor is considered malignant and the patient is\ndiagnosed with cancer.\nHOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCES\nCancer Arises from Homeostatic Imbalances\nCancer is an extremely complex condition, capable of arising from a wide variety of genetic and environmental\ncauses. Typically, mutations or aberrations in a cell’s DNA that compromise normal cell cycle control systems lead\nto cancerous tumors. Cell cycle control is an example of a homeostatic mechanism that maintains proper cell\nfunction and health. While progressing through the phases of the cell cycle, a large variety of intracellular molecules\n3.5 • Cell Growth and Division\n111\nprovide stop and go signals to regulate movement forward to the next phase. These signals are maintained in an\nintricate balance so that the cell only proceeds to the next phase when it is ready. This homeostatic control of the\ncell cycle can be thought of like a car’s cruise control. Cruise control will continually apply just the right amount of\nacceleration to maintain a desired speed, unless the driver hits the brakes, in which case the car will slow down.\nSimilarly, the cell includes molecular messengers, such as cyclins, that push the cell forward in its cycle.\nIn addition to cyclins, a class of proteins that are encoded by genes called proto-oncogenes provide important\nsignals that regulate the cell cycle and move it forward. Examples of proto-oncogene products include cell-surface\nreceptors for growth factors, or cell-signaling molecules, two classes of molecules that can promote DNA replication\nand cell division. In contrast, a second class of genes known as tumor suppressor genes sends stop signals during a\ncell cycle.', '2\nc.\n3\nd.\n4\n23.

What is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)?,"['The organelles of the endomembrane system include the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi\napparatus, and vesicles.\nEndoplasmic Reticulum\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a system of channels that is continuous with the nuclear membrane (or\n“envelope”) covering the nucleus and composed of the same lipid bilayer material. The ER can be thought of as a\nseries of winding thoroughfares similar to the waterway canals in Venice. The ER provides passages throughout\nmuch of the cell that function in transporting, synthesizing, and storing materials. The winding structure of the ER\nresults in a large membranous surface area that supports its many functions (Figure 3.14).\n92\n3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 3.14\nEndoplasmic Reticulum (ER)\n(a) The ER is a winding network of thin membranous sacs found in close association with\nthe cell nucleus.

(b)\nRough ER is studded with numerous ribosomes, which are sites of protein synthesis (source: mouse tissue). EM × 110,000. (c) Smooth ER\nsynthesizes phospholipids, steroid hormones, regulates the concentration of cellular Ca++, metabolizes some carbohydrates, and breaks\ndown certain toxins (source: mouse tissue). EM × 110,510. (Micrographs provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School\n© 2012)\nEndoplasmic reticulum can exist in two forms: rough ER and smooth ER. These two types of ER perform some very\ndifferent functions and can be found in very different amounts depending on the type of cell. Rough ER (RER) is so-\ncalled because its membrane is dotted with embedded granules—organelles called ribosomes, giving the RER a\nbumpy appearance. A ribosome is an organelle that serves as the site of protein synthesis. It is composed of two\nribosomal RNA subunits that wrap around mRNA to start the process of translation, followed by protein synthesis.\nSmooth ER (SER) lacks these ribosomes.\nOne of the main functions of the smooth ER is in the synthesis of lipids.', 'The transport\nof Cl– and the maintenance of an electronegative environment outside of the cell attract positive ions such as\nNa+ to the extracellular space. The accumulation of both Cl– and Na+ ions in the extracellular space creates\nsolute-rich mucus, which has a low concentration of water molecules. As a result, through osmosis, water\nmoves from cells and extracellular matrix into the mucus, “thinning” it out. This is how, in a normal respiratory\nsystem, the mucus is kept sufficiently watered-down to be propelled out of the respiratory system.\nIf the CFTR channel is absent, Cl– ions are not transported out of the cell in adequate numbers, thus preventing\nthem from drawing positive ions. The absence of ions in the secreted mucus results in the lack of a normal water\nconcentration gradient. Thus, there is no osmotic pressure pulling water into the mucus. The resulting mucus is\nthick and sticky, and the ciliated epithelia cannot effectively remove it from the respiratory system. Passageways\nin the lungs become blocked with mucus, along with the debris it carries. Bacterial infections occur more easily\nbecause bacterial cells are not effectively carried away from the lungs.\n3.2 • The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles\n91\nFIGURE 3.13\nPrototypical Human Cell\nWhile this image is not indicative of any one particular human cell, it is a prototypical example\nof a cell containing the primary organelles and internal structures.\nOrganelles of the Endomembrane System\nA set of three major organelles together form a system within the cell called the endomembrane system. These\norganelles work together to perform various cellular jobs, including the task of producing, packaging, and exporting\ncertain cellular products. The organelles of the endomembrane system include the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi\napparatus, and vesicles.\nEndoplasmic Reticulum\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a system of channels that is continuous with the nuclear membrane (or\n“envelope”) covering the nucleus and composed of the same lipid bilayer material. The ER can be thought of as a\nseries of winding thoroughfares similar to the waterway canals in Venice.', 'The\nendoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and\nlysosomes share a functional connectivity and are\ncollectively referred to as the endomembrane system.\nThere are two types of ER: smooth and rough. While\nthe smooth ER performs many functions, including lipid\nsynthesis and ion storage, the rough ER is mainly\nresponsible for protein synthesis using its associated\nribosomes. The rough ER sends newly made proteins\nto the Golgi apparatus where they are modified and\npackaged for delivery to various locations within or\noutside of the cell. Some of these protein products are\nenzymes destined to break down unwanted material\nand are packaged as lysosomes for use inside the cell.\nCells also contain mitochondria and peroxisomes,\nwhich are the organelles responsible for producing the\ncell’s energy supply and detoxifying certain chemicals,\nrespectively. Biochemical reactions within\nmitochondria transform energy-carrying molecules into\nthe usable form of cellular energy known as ATP.\nPeroxisomes contain enzymes that transform harmful\nsubstances such as free radicals into oxygen and water.\nCells also contain a miniaturized “skeleton” of protein\nfilaments that extend throughout its interior. Three\ndifferent kinds of filaments compose this cytoskeleton\n(in order of increasing thickness): microfilaments,\nintermediate filaments, and microtubules. Each\ncytoskeletal component performs unique functions as\nwell as provides a supportive framework for the cell.\n3.3 The Nucleus and DNA Replication\nThe nucleus is the command center of the cell,\ncontaining the genetic instructions for all of the\nmaterials a cell will make (and thus all of its functions it\ncan perform). The nucleus is encased within a\nmembrane of two interconnected lipid bilayers, side-\nby-side. This nuclear envelope is studded with protein-\nlined pores that allow materials to be trafficked into\nand out of the nucleus. The nucleus contains one or\nmore nucleoli, which serve as sites for ribosome\nsynthesis. The nucleus houses the genetic material of\nthe cell: DNA. DNA is normally found as a loosely\ncontained structure called chromatin within the\nnucleus, where it is wound up and associated with a\nvariety of histone proteins. When a cell is about to\ndivide, the chromatin coils tightly and condenses to\nform chromosomes.', '1 The Cell Membrane\nThe cell membrane provides a barrier around the cell,\nseparating its internal components from the\nextracellular environment. It is composed of a\nphospholipid bilayer, with hydrophobic internal lipid\n“tails” and hydrophilic external phosphate “heads.”\nVarious membrane proteins are scattered throughout\nthe bilayer, both inserted within it and attached to it\nperipherally. The cell membrane is selectively\npermeable, allowing only a limited number of materials\nto diffuse through its lipid bilayer. All materials that\ncross the membrane do so using passive (non energy-\nrequiring) or active (energy-requiring) transport\nprocesses. During passive transport, materials move by\nsimple diffusion or by facilitated diffusion through the\nmembrane, down their concentration gradient. Water\n118\n3 • Chapter Review\nAccess for free at openstax.org\npasses through the membrane in a diffusion process\ncalled osmosis. During active transport, energy is\nexpended to assist material movement across the\nmembrane in a direction against their concentration\ngradient. Active transport may take place with the help\nof protein pumps or through the use of vesicles.\n3.2 The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles\nThe internal environmental of a living cell is made up of\na fluid, jelly-like substance called cytosol, which\nconsists mainly of water, but also contains various\ndissolved nutrients and other molecules. The cell\ncontains an array of cellular organelles, each one\nperforming a unique function and helping to maintain\nthe health and activity of the cell.

Where is the glycocalyx located?,"['FIGURE 3.3\nPhospholipid Bilayer\nThe phospholipid bilayer consists of two adjacent sheets of phospholipids, arranged tail to tail. The\nhydrophobic tails associate with one another, forming the interior of the membrane. The polar heads contact the fluid inside and outside of\nthe cell.\nMembrane Proteins\nThe lipid bilayer forms the basis of the cell membrane, but it is peppered throughout with various proteins. Two\ndifferent types of proteins that are commonly associated with the cell membrane are the integral proteins and\nperipheral protein (Figure 3.4). As its name suggests, an integral protein is a protein that is embedded in the\nmembrane. A channel protein is an example of an integral protein that selectively allows particular materials, such\n3.1 • The Cell Membrane\n83\nas certain ions, to pass into or out of the cell.\nFIGURE 3.4\nCell Membrane\nThe cell membrane of the cell is a phospholipid bilayer containing many different molecular components,\nincluding proteins and cholesterol, some with carbohydrate groups attached.\nAnother important group of integral proteins are cell recognition proteins, which serve to mark a cell’s identity so\nthat it can be recognized by other cells. A receptor is a type of recognition protein that can selectively bind a specific\nmolecule outside the cell, and this binding induces a chemical reaction within the cell. A ligand is the specific\nmolecule that binds to and activates a receptor. Some integral proteins serve dual roles as both a receptor and an\nion channel. One example of a receptor-ligand interaction is the receptors on nerve cells that bind\nneurotransmitters, such as dopamine. When a dopamine molecule binds to a dopamine receptor protein, a channel\nwithin the transmembrane protein opens to allow certain ions to flow into the cell.\nSome integral membrane proteins are glycoproteins. A glycoprotein is a protein that has carbohydrate molecules\nattached, which extend into the extracellular matrix. The attached carbohydrate tags on glycoproteins aid in cell\nrecognition. The carbohydrates that extend from membrane proteins and even from some membrane lipids\ncollectively form the glycocalyx. The glycocalyx is a fuzzy-appearing coating around the cell formed from\nglycoproteins and other carbohydrates attached to the cell membrane. The glycocalyx can have various roles.', 'Some integral membrane proteins are glycoproteins.

For\nexample, it may have molecules that allow the cell to bind to another cell, it may contain receptors for hormones, or\nit might have enzymes to break down nutrients. The glycocalyces found in a person’s body are products of that\nperson’s genetic makeup. They give each of the individual’s trillions of cells the “identity” of belonging in the\nperson’s body. This identity is the primary way that a person’s immune defense cells “know” not to attack the\nperson’s own body cells, but it also is the reason organs donated by another person might be rejected.\nPeripheral proteins are typically found on the inner or outer surface of the lipid bilayer but can also be attached to\nthe internal or external surface of an integral protein. These proteins typically perform a specific function for the\ncell. Some peripheral proteins on the surface of intestinal cells, for example, act as digestive enzymes to break down\nnutrients to sizes that can pass through the cells and into the bloodstream.\nTransport across the Cell Membrane\nOne of the great wonders of the cell membrane is its ability to regulate the concentration of substances inside the\ncell. These substances include ions such as Ca++, Na+, K+, and Cl–; nutrients including sugars, fatty acids, and amino\nacids; and waste products, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), which must leave the cell.\nThe membrane’s lipid bilayer structure provides the first level of control. The phospholipids are tightly packed\ntogether, and the membrane has a hydrophobic interior. This structure causes the membrane to be selectively\npermeable.

Neither of these examples requires any energy\non the part of the cell, and therefore they use passive transport to move across the membrane.\nBefore moving on, you need to review the gases that can diffuse across a cell membrane. Because cells rapidly use\nup oxygen during metabolism, there is typically a lower concentration of O2 inside the cell than outside. As a result,\noxygen will diffuse from the interstitial fluid directly through the lipid bilayer of the membrane and into the\ncytoplasm within the cell. On the other hand, because cells produce CO2 as a byproduct of metabolism, CO2\nconcentrations rise within the cytoplasm; therefore, CO2 will move from the cell through the lipid bilayer and into the\ninterstitial fluid, where its concentration is lower. This mechanism of molecules moving across a cell membrane\nfrom the side where they are more concentrated to the side where they are less concentrated is a form of passive\ntransport called simple diffusion (Figure 3.5).\nFIGURE 3.5\nSimple Diffusion across the Cell (Plasma) Membrane\nThe structure of the lipid bilayer allows small, uncharged\nsubstances such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, and hydrophobic molecules such as lipids, to pass through the cell membrane, down their\nconcentration gradient, by simple diffusion.\nLarge polar or ionic molecules, which are hydrophilic, cannot easily cross the phospholipid bilayer. Very small polar\nmolecules, such as water, can cross via simple diffusion due to their small size.

Molecules (or ions) will spread/diffuse from where they are more concentrated to where they are\nless concentrated until they are equally distributed in that space. (When molecules move in this way, they are said to\nmove down their concentration gradient.) Diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of higher\nconcentration to an area of lower concentration. A couple of common examples will help to illustrate this concept.\nImagine being inside a closed bathroom. If a bottle of perfume were sprayed, the scent molecules would naturally\ndiffuse from the spot where they left the bottle to all corners of the bathroom, and this diffusion would go on until no\nmore concentration gradient remains. Another example is a spoonful of sugar placed in a cup of tea. Eventually the\nsugar will diffuse throughout the tea until no concentration gradient remains. In both cases, if the room is warmer or\nthe tea hotter, diffusion occurs even faster as the molecules are bumping into each other and spreading out faster\nthan at cooler temperatures. Having an internal body temperature around 98.6° F thus also aids in diffusion of\nparticles within the body.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nVisit this link (http://openstax.org/l/diffusion) to see diffusion and how it is propelled by the kinetic energy of\nmolecules in solution.

The\noriginal DNA strands serve as templates from which\nthe nucleotide sequence of the new strands are\ndetermined and synthesized. When replication is\ncompleted, two identical DNA molecules exist.

Next, tRNA molecules shuttle the\nappropriate amino acids to the ribosome, one-by-one,\ncoded by sequential triplet codons on the mRNA, until\nthe protein is fully synthesized. When completed, the\nmRNA detaches from the ribosome, and the protein is\nreleased. Typically, multiple ribosomes attach to a\nsingle mRNA molecule at once such that multiple\nproteins can be manufactured from the mRNA\nconcurrently.\n3 • Chapter Review\n119\n3.5 Cell Growth and Division\nThe life of cell consists of stages that make up the cell\ncycle. After a cell is born, it passes through an\ninterphase before it is ready to replicate itself and\nproduce daughter cells. This interphase includes two\ngap phases (G1 and G2), as well as an S phase, during\nwhich its DNA is replicated in preparation for cell\ndivision. The cell cycle is under precise regulation by\nchemical messengers both inside and outside the cell\nthat provide “stop” and “go” signals for movement\nfrom one phase to the next. Failures of these signals\ncan result in cells that continue to divide\nuncontrollably, which can lead to cancer.\nOnce a cell has completed interphase and is ready for\ncell division, it proceeds through four separate stages\nof mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and\ntelophase). Telophase is followed by the division of the\ncytoplasm (cytokinesis), which generates two daughter\ncells. This process takes place in all normally dividing\ncells of the body except for the germ cells that produce\neggs and sperm.\n3.6 Cellular Differentiation\nOne of the major areas of research in biology is that of\nhow cells specialize to assume their unique structures\nand functions, since all cells essentially originate from\na single fertilized egg. Cell differentiation is the process\nof cells becoming specialized as they body develops.', 'For example, the DNA triplet CAC (cytosine, adenine, and cytosine) specifies the\namino acid valine. Therefore, a gene, which is composed of multiple triplets in a unique sequence, provides the code\nto build an entire protein, with multiple amino acids in the proper sequence (Figure 3.25). The mechanism by which\ncells turn the DNA code into a protein product is a two-step process, with an RNA molecule as the intermediate.\nFIGURE 3.25\nThe Genetic Code\nDNA holds all of the genetic information necessary to build a cell’s proteins. The nucleotide sequence\nof a gene is ultimately translated into an amino acid sequence of the gene’s corresponding protein.\nFrom DNA to RNA: Transcription\nDNA is housed within the nucleus, and protein synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm, thus there must be some sort\nof intermediate messenger that leaves the nucleus and manages protein synthesis. This intermediate messenger is\nmessenger RNA (mRNA), a single-stranded nucleic acid that carries a copy of the genetic code for a single gene out\nof the nucleus and into the cytoplasm where it is used to produce proteins.\nThere are several different types of RNA, each having different functions in the cell. The structure of RNA is similar\nto DNA with a few small exceptions. For one thing, unlike DNA, most types of RNA, including mRNA, are single-\nstranded and contain no complementary strand. Second, the ribose sugar in RNA contains an additional oxygen\n3.4 • Protein Synthesis\n103\natom compared with DNA. Finally, instead of the base thymine, RNA contains the base uracil. This means that\nadenine will always pair up with uracil during the protein synthesis process.\nGene expression begins with the process called transcription, which is the synthesis of a strand of mRNA that is\ncomplementary to the gene of interest. This process is called transcription because the mRNA is like a transcript, or\ncopy, of the gene’s DNA code. Transcription begins in a fashion somewhat like DNA replication, in that a region of\nDNA unwinds and the two strands separate, however, only that small portion of the DNA will be split apart. The\ntriplets within the gene on this section of the DNA molecule are used as the template to transcribe the\ncomplementary strand of RNA (Figure 3.26).', 'This refers to the fact\nthat DNA contains the information necessary for the cell to build one very important type of molecule: the protein.\nMost structural components of the cell are made up, at least in part, by proteins and virtually all the functions that a\ncell carries out are completed with the help of proteins. One of the most important classes of proteins is enzymes,\nwhich help speed up necessary biochemical reactions that take place inside the cell. Some of these critical\nbiochemical reactions include building larger molecules from smaller components (such as occurs during DNA\nreplication or synthesis of microtubules) and breaking down larger molecules into smaller components (such as\nwhen harvesting chemical energy from nutrient molecules). Whatever the cellular process may be, it is almost sure\nto involve proteins. Just as the cell’s genome describes its full complement of DNA, a cell’s proteome is its full\ncomplement of proteins. Protein synthesis begins with genes. A gene is a functional segment of DNA that provides\nthe genetic information necessary to build a protein. Each particular gene provides the code necessary to construct\na particular protein. Gene expression, which transforms the information coded in a gene to a final gene product,\nultimately dictates the structure and function of a cell by determining which proteins are made.\nThe interpretation of genes works in the following way. Recall that proteins are polymers, or chains, of many amino\nacid building blocks. The sequence of bases in a gene (that is, its sequence of A, T, C, G nucleotides) translates to an\namino acid sequence. A triplet is a section of three DNA bases in a row that codes for a specific amino acid. Similar\nto the way in which the three-letter code d-o-g signals the image of a dog, the three-letter DNA base code signals\nthe use of a particular amino acid. For example, the DNA triplet CAC (cytosine, adenine, and cytosine) specifies the\namino acid valine. Therefore, a gene, which is composed of multiple triplets in a unique sequence, provides the code\nto build an entire protein, with multiple amino acids in the proper sequence (Figure 3.25). The mechanism by which\ncells turn the DNA code into a protein product is a two-step process, with an RNA molecule as the intermediate.', 'Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a ribose-containing nucleotide that helps manifest the genetic\ncode as protein. RNA contains ribose, one phosphate group, and one nitrogen-containing base, but the “choices” of\nbase for RNA are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil.\nThe nitrogen-containing bases adenine and guanine are classified as purines. A purine is a nitrogen-containing\nmolecule with a double ring structure, which accommodates several nitrogen atoms. The bases cytosine, thymine\n(found in DNA only) and uracil (found in RNA only) are pyramidines. A pyramidine is a nitrogen-containing base with\n72\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\na single ring structure\nBonds formed by dehydration synthesis between the pentose sugar of one nucleic acid monomer and the phosphate\ngroup of another form a “backbone,” from which the components’ nitrogen-containing bases protrude. In DNA, two\nsuch backbones attach at their protruding bases via hydrogen bonds. These twist to form a shape known as a\ndouble helix (Figure 2.29). The sequence of nitrogen-containing bases within a strand of DNA form the genes that\nact as a molecular code instructing cells in the assembly of amino acids into proteins. Humans have almost 22,000\ngenes in their DNA, locked up in the 46 chromosomes inside the nucleus of each cell (except red blood cells which\nlose their nuclei during development). These genes carry the genetic code to build one’s body, and are unique for\neach individual except identical twins.\nFIGURE 2.29\nDNA\nIn the DNA double helix, two strands attach via hydrogen bonds between the bases of the component nucleotides.\nIn contrast, RNA consists of a single strand of sugar-phosphate backbone studded with bases.

Where do tRNA molecules shuttle the appropriate amino acids to during protein synthesis?,"['On the other end is a base sequence that\nmatches the codon specifying its particular amino acid. This sequence of three bases on the tRNA molecule is called\nan anticodon. For example, a tRNA responsible for shuttling the amino acid glycine contains a binding site for\nglycine on one end. On the other end it contains an anticodon that complements the glycine codon (GGA is a codon\nfor glycine, and so the tRNAs anticodon would read CCU). Equipped with its particular cargo and matching\nanticodon, a tRNA molecule can read its recognized mRNA codon and bring the corresponding amino acid to the\ngrowing chain (Figure 3.28).\n3.4 • Protein Synthesis\n105\nFIGURE 3.28\nTranslation from RNA to Protein\nDuring translation, the mRNA transcript is “read” by a functional complex consisting of\nthe ribosome and tRNA molecules. tRNAs bring the appropriate amino acids in sequence to the growing polypeptide chain by matching\ntheir anti-codons with codons on the mRNA strand.\nMuch like the processes of DNA replication and transcription, translation consists of three main stages: initiation,\nelongation, and termination. Initiation takes place with the binding of a ribosome to an mRNA transcript. The\nelongation stage involves the recognition of a tRNA anticodon with the next mRNA codon in the sequence. Once the\nanticodon and codon sequences are bound (remember, they are complementary base pairs), the tRNA presents its\namino acid cargo and the growing polypeptide strand is attached to this next amino acid. This attachment takes\nplace with the assistance of various enzymes and requires energy. The tRNA molecule then releases the mRNA\nstrand, the mRNA strand shifts one codon over in the ribosome, and the next appropriate tRNA arrives with its\nmatching anticodon. This process continues until the final codon on the mRNA is reached which provides a “stop”\nmessage that signals termination of translation and triggers the release of the complete, newly synthesized protein.\nThus, a gene within the DNA molecule is transcribed into mRNA, which is then translated into a protein product\n(Figure 3.29).', 'This nuclear envelope is studded with protein-\nlined pores that allow materials to be trafficked into\nand out of the nucleus. The nucleus contains one or\nmore nucleoli, which serve as sites for ribosome\nsynthesis. The nucleus houses the genetic material of\nthe cell: DNA. DNA is normally found as a loosely\ncontained structure called chromatin within the\nnucleus, where it is wound up and associated with a\nvariety of histone proteins. When a cell is about to\ndivide, the chromatin coils tightly and condenses to\nform chromosomes.\nThere is a pool of cells constantly dividing within your\nbody. The result is billions of new cells being created\neach day. Before any cell is ready to divide, it must\nreplicate its DNA so that each new daughter cell will\nreceive an exact copy of the organism’s genome. A\nvariety of enzymes are enlisted during DNA replication.\nThese enzymes unwind the DNA molecule, separate\nthe two strands, and assist with the building of\ncomplementary strands along each parent strand. The\noriginal DNA strands serve as templates from which\nthe nucleotide sequence of the new strands are\ndetermined and synthesized. When replication is\ncompleted, two identical DNA molecules exist. Each\none contains one original strand and one newly\nsynthesized complementary strand.\n3.4 Protein Synthesis\nDNA stores the information necessary for instructing\nthe cell to perform all of its functions. Cells use the\ngenetic code stored within DNA to build proteins,\nwhich ultimately determine the structure and function\nof the cell. This genetic code lies in the particular\nsequence of nucleotides that make up each gene along\nthe DNA molecule. To “read” this code, the cell must\nperform two sequential steps. In the first step,\ntranscription, the DNA code is converted into an RNA\ncode. A molecule of messenger RNA that is\ncomplementary to a specific gene is synthesized in a\nprocess similar to DNA replication. The molecule of\nmRNA provides the code to synthesize a protein. In the\nprocess of translation, the mRNA attaches to a\nribosome. Next, tRNA molecules shuttle the\nappropriate amino acids to the ribosome, one-by-one,\ncoded by sequential triplet codons on the mRNA, until\nthe protein is fully synthesized.', 'Translation is the process of synthesizing a chain of amino acids called a\npolypeptide. Translation requires two major aids: first, a “translator,” the molecule that will conduct the translation,\nand second, a substrate on which the mRNA strand is translated into a new protein, like the translator’s “desk.” Both\nof these requirements are fulfilled by other types of RNA. The substrate on which translation takes place is the\nribosome.\nRemember that many of a cell’s ribosomes are found associated with the rough ER, and carry out the synthesis of\nproteins destined for the Golgi apparatus. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a type of RNA that, together with proteins,\ncomposes the structure of the ribosome. Ribosomes exist in the cytoplasm as two distinct components, a small and\na large subunit. When an mRNA molecule is ready to be translated, the two subunits come together and attach to\nthe mRNA. The ribosome provides a substrate for translation, bringing together and aligning the mRNA molecule\nwith the molecular “translators” that must decipher its code.\nThe other major requirement for protein synthesis is the translator molecules that physically “read” the mRNA\ncodons. Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a type of RNA that ferries the appropriate corresponding amino acids to the\nribosome, and attaches each new amino acid to the last, building the polypeptide chain one-by-one. Thus tRNA\ntransfers specific amino acids from the cytoplasm to a growing polypeptide. The tRNA molecules must be able to\nrecognize the codons on mRNA and match them with the correct amino acid. The tRNA is modified for this function.\nOn one end of its structure is a binding site for a specific amino acid. On the other end is a base sequence that\nmatches the codon specifying its particular amino acid. This sequence of three bases on the tRNA molecule is called\nan anticodon. For example, a tRNA responsible for shuttling the amino acid glycine contains a binding site for\nglycine on one end.

These proteins are increasingly bundled\nand condensed into chromatin, which is packed tightly into chromosomes when the cell is ready to divide.\nDNA Replication\nIn order for an organism to grow, develop, and maintain its health, cells must reproduce themselves by dividing to\nproduce two new daughter cells, each with the full complement of DNA as found in the original cell. Billions of new\ncells are produced in an adult human every day. Only very few cell types in the body do not divide, including nerve\ncells, skeletal muscle fibers, and cardiac muscle cells. The division time of different cell types varies. Epithelial cells\nof the skin and gastrointestinal lining, for instance, divide very frequently to replace those that are constantly being\nrubbed off of the surface by friction.\nA DNA molecule is made of two strands that “complement” each other in the sense that the molecules that\ncompose the strands fit together and bind to each other, creating a double-stranded molecule that looks much like a\nlong, twisted ladder. This double helix can be constructed easily because the two strands are antiparallel, meaning\nthe two strands run in opposite directions. Each side rail of the DNA ladder is composed of alternating sugar and\nphosphate groups (Figure 3.23). The two sides of the ladder are not identical, but are complementary.', 'HOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCES\nTissues and Cancer\nCancer is a generic term for many diseases in which cells escape regulatory signals. Uncontrolled growth, invasion\ninto adjacent tissues, and colonization of other organs, if not treated early enough, are its hallmarks. Health suffers\nwhen tumors “rob” blood supply from the “normal” organs.\nA mutation is defined as a permanent change in the DNA of a cell. Epigenetic modifications, changes that do not\naffect the code of the DNA but alter how the DNA is decoded, are also known to generate abnormal cells. Alterations\nin the genetic material may be caused by environmental agents, infectious agents, or errors in the replication of DNA\nthat accumulate with age. Many mutations do not cause any noticeable change in the functions of a cell. However, if\nthe modification affects key proteins that have an impact on the cell’s ability to proliferate in an orderly fashion, the\ncell starts to divide abnormally. As changes in cells accumulate, they lose their ability to form regular tissues. A\ntumor, a mass of cells displaying abnormal architecture, forms in the tissue. Many tumors are benign, meaning they\ndo not metastasize nor cause disease. A tumor becomes malignant, or cancerous, when it breaches the confines of\nits tissue, promotes angiogenesis, attracts the growth of capillaries, and metastasizes to other organs (Figure 4.22).\nThe specific names of cancers reflect the tissue of origin. Cancers derived from epithelial cells are referred to as\ncarcinomas. Cancer in myeloid tissue or blood cells form myelomas. Leukemias are cancers of white blood cells,\nwhereas sarcomas derive from connective tissue. Cells in tumors differ both in structure and function. Some cells,\ncalled cancer stem cells, appear to be a subtype of cell responsible for uncontrolled growth. Recent research shows\nthat contrary to what was previously assumed, tumors are not disorganized masses of cells, but have their own\nstructures.\n4.6 • Tissue Injury and Aging\n153\nFIGURE 4.22\nDevelopment of Cancer\nNote the change in cell size, nucleus size, and organization in the tissue.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/tumor) to learn more about tumors.

Adjoining cells form a specialized intercellular connection between\ntheir cell membranes called a cell junction. The epithelial cells exhibit polarity with differences in structure and\nfunction between the exposed or apical facing surface of the cell and the basal surface close to the underlying body\nstructures. The basal lamina, a mixture of glycoproteins and collagen, provides an attachment site for the\nepithelium, separating it from underlying connective tissue. The basal lamina attaches to a reticular lamina, which\nis secreted by the underlying connective tissue, forming a basement membrane that helps hold it all together.\nEpithelial tissues are nearly completely avascular. For instance, no blood vessels cross the basement membrane to\nenter the tissue, and nutrients must come by diffusion or absorption from underlying tissues or the surface. Many\nepithelial tissues are capable of rapidly replacing damaged and dead cells. Sloughing off of damaged or dead cells is\na characteristic of surface epithelium and allows our airways and digestive tracts to rapidly replace damaged cells\nwith new cells.\nGeneralized Functions of Epithelial Tissue\nEpithelial tissues provide the body’s first line of protection from physical, chemical, and biological wear and tear.\nThe cells of an epithelium act as gatekeepers of the body controlling permeability and allowing selective transfer of\nmaterials across a physical barrier.

What is an anchoring junction?,"['Cell to Cell Junctions\nCells of epithelia are closely connected and are not separated by intracellular material. Three basic types of\nconnections allow varying degrees of interaction between the cells: tight junctions, anchoring junctions, and gap\njunctions (Figure 4.5).\n4.2 • Epithelial Tissue\n131\nFIGURE 4.5\nTypes of Cell Junctions\nThe three basic types of cell-to-cell junctions are tight junctions, gap junctions, and anchoring\njunctions.\nAt one end of the spectrum is the tight junction, which separates the cells into apical and basal compartments.\nWhen two adjacent epithelial cells form a tight junction, there is no extracellular space between them and the\nmovement of substances through the extracellular space between the cells is blocked. This enables the epithelia to\nact as selective barriers. An anchoring junction includes several types of cell junctions that help stabilize epithelial\ntissues. Anchoring junctions are common on the lateral and basal surfaces of cells where they provide strong and\nflexible connections. There are three types of anchoring junctions: desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, and adherens.\nDesmosomes occur in patches on the membranes of cells. The patches are structural proteins on the inner surface\nof the cell’s membrane. The adhesion molecule, cadherin, is embedded in these patches and projects through the\ncell membrane to link with the cadherin molecules of adjacent cells. These connections are especially important in\nholding cells together. Hemidesmosomes, which look like half a desmosome, link cells to the extracellular matrix,\nfor example, the basal lamina. While similar in appearance to desmosomes, they include the adhesion proteins\ncalled integrins rather than cadherins. Adherens junctions use either cadherins or integrins depending on whether\nthey are linking to other cells or matrix. The junctions are characterized by the presence of the contractile protein\nactin located on the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. The actin can connect isolated patches or form a\nbelt-like structure inside the cell. These junctions influence the shape and folding of the epithelial tissue.', 'All substances that enter the body must cross an epithelium.

The epithelium of the small intestine releases digestive enzymes, for example. Cells lining the\nrespiratory tract secrete mucous that traps incoming microorganisms and particles. A glandular epithelium contains\nmany secretory cells.\nThe Epithelial Cell\nEpithelial cells are typically characterized by the polarized distribution of organelles and membrane-bound proteins\nbetween their basal and apical surfaces. Particular structures found in some epithelial cells are an adaptation to\nspecific functions. Certain organelles are segregated to the basal sides, whereas other organelles and extensions,\nsuch as cilia, when present, are on the apical surface.\nCilia are microscopic extensions of the apical cell membrane that are supported by microtubules. They beat in\nunison and move fluids as well as trapped particles. Ciliated epithelium lines the ventricles of the brain where it\nhelps circulate the cerebrospinal fluid. The ciliated epithelium of your airway forms a mucociliary escalator that\nsweeps particles of dust and pathogens trapped in the secreted mucous toward the throat. It is called an escalator\nbecause it continuously pushes mucous with trapped particles upward. In contrast, nasal cilia sweep the mucous\nblanket down towards your throat. In both cases, the transported materials are usually swallowed, and end up in the\nacidic environment of your stomach.\nCell to Cell Junctions\nCells of epithelia are closely connected and are not separated by intracellular material.

These junctions allow electrical and metabolic coupling of adjacent cells, which coordinates function\nin large groups of cells.\nClassification of Epithelial Tissues\nEpithelial tissues are classified according to the shape of the cells and number of the cell layers formed (Figure 4.6).\nCell shapes can be squamous (flattened and thin), cuboidal (boxy, as wide as it is tall), or columnar (rectangular,\ntaller than it is wide). Similarly, the number of cell layers in the tissue can be one—where every cell rests on the\nbasal lamina—which is a simple epithelium, or more than one, which is a stratified epithelium and only the basal\nlayer of cells rests on the basal lamina. Pseudostratified (pseudo- = “false”) describes tissue with a single layer of\nirregularly shaped cells that give the appearance of more than one layer. Transitional describes a form of specialized\nstratified epithelium in which the shape of the cells can vary.\nFIGURE 4.6\nCells of Epithelial Tissue\nSimple epithelial tissue is organized as a single layer of cells and stratified epithelial tissue is\nformed by several layers of cells.\nSimple Epithelium\nThe shape of the cells in the single cell layer of simple epithelium reflects the functioning of those cells.

Where do hemidesmosomes link cells to?,"['In a growing fetus, fingerprints form where the cells of the stratum basale meet the papillae of the underlying\ndermal layer (papillary layer), resulting in the formation of the ridges on your fingers that you recognize as\nfingerprints. Fingerprints are unique to each individual and are used for forensic analyses because the patterns do\nnot change with the growth and aging processes.\nStratum Spinosum\nAs the name suggests, the stratum spinosum is spiny in appearance due to the protruding cell processes that join\nthe cells via a structure called a desmosome. The desmosomes interlock with each other and strengthen the bond\nbetween the cells. It is interesting to note that the “spiny” nature of this layer is an artifact of the staining process.\nUnstained epidermis samples do not exhibit this characteristic appearance. The stratum spinosum is composed of\neight to 10 layers of keratinocytes, formed as a result of cell division in the stratum basale (Figure 5.6). Interspersed\namong the keratinocytes of this layer is a type of dendritic cell called the Langerhans cell, which functions as a\nmacrophage by engulfing bacteria, foreign particles, and damaged cells that occur in this layer.\nFIGURE 5.6\nCells of the Epidermis\nThe cells in the different layers of the epidermis originate from basal cells located in the stratum\nbasale, yet the cells of each layer are distinctively different.

Like the cuboidal epithelia, this epithelium is active in the absorption and secretion of\nmolecules. Simple columnar epithelium forms the lining of some sections of the digestive system and parts of the\nfemale reproductive tract. Ciliated columnar epithelium is composed of simple columnar epithelial cells with cilia on\ntheir apical surfaces. These epithelial cells are found in the lining of the fallopian tubes and parts of the respiratory\nsystem, where the beating of the cilia helps remove particulate matter.\nPseudostratified columnar epithelium is a type of epithelium that appears to be stratified but instead consists of a\nsingle layer of irregularly shaped and differently sized columnar cells. In pseudostratified epithelium, nuclei of\nneighboring cells appear at different levels rather than clustered in the basal end. The arrangement gives the\nappearance of stratification; but in fact all the cells are in contact with the basal lamina, although some do not reach\nthe apical surface. Pseudostratified columnar epithelium is found in the respiratory tract, where some of these cells\nhave cilia.\nBoth simple and pseudostratified columnar epithelia are heterogeneous epithelia because they include additional\ntypes of cells interspersed among the epithelial cells.

Molecules (or ions) will spread/diffuse from where they are more concentrated to where they are\nless concentrated until they are equally distributed in that space. (When molecules move in this way, they are said to\nmove down their concentration gradient.) Diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of higher\nconcentration to an area of lower concentration. A couple of common examples will help to illustrate this concept.\nImagine being inside a closed bathroom. If a bottle of perfume were sprayed, the scent molecules would naturally\ndiffuse from the spot where they left the bottle to all corners of the bathroom, and this diffusion would go on until no\nmore concentration gradient remains. Another example is a spoonful of sugar placed in a cup of tea. Eventually the\nsugar will diffuse throughout the tea until no concentration gradient remains. In both cases, if the room is warmer or\nthe tea hotter, diffusion occurs even faster as the molecules are bumping into each other and spreading out faster\nthan at cooler temperatures. Having an internal body temperature around 98.6° F thus also aids in diffusion of\nparticles within the body.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nVisit this link (http://openstax.org/l/diffusion) to see diffusion and how it is propelled by the kinetic energy of\nmolecules in solution. How does temperature affect diffusion rate, and why?\nWhenever a substance exists in greater concentration on one side of a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell\nmembranes, any substance that can move down its concentration gradient across the membrane will do so.\nConsider substances that can easily diffuse through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, such as the gases oxygen\n(O2) and CO2. O2 generally diffuses into cells because it is more concentrated outside of them, and CO2 typically\ndiffuses out of cells because it is more concentrated inside of them. Neither of these examples requires any energy\non the part of the cell, and therefore they use passive transport to move across the membrane.\nBefore moving on, you need to review the gases that can diffuse across a cell membrane. Because cells rapidly use\nup oxygen during metabolism, there is typically a lower concentration of O2 inside the cell than outside.', 'A typical neuron\ndisplays a distinctive morphology: a large cell body\nbranches out into short extensions called dendrites,\nwhich receive chemical signals from other neurons,\nand a long tail called an axon, which relays signals\naway from the cell to other neurons, muscles, or\nglands. Many axons are wrapped by a myelin sheath, a\nlipid derivative that acts as an insulator and speeds up\nthe transmission of the action potential.

Clotting\n(coagulation) reduces blood loss from damaged blood vessels and forms a network of fibrin proteins that trap blood\ncells and bind the edges of the wound together. A scab forms when the clot dries, reducing the risk of infection.\nSometimes a mixture of dead leukocytes and fluid called pus accumulates in the wound. As healing progresses,\nfibroblasts from the surrounding connective tissues replace the collagen and extracellular material lost by the injury.\nAngiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, results in vascularization of the new tissue known as granulation\ntissue. The clot retracts pulling the edges of the wound together, and it slowly dissolves as the tissue is repaired.\nWhen a large amount of granulation tissue forms and capillaries disappear, a pale scar is often visible in the healed\narea. A primary union describes the healing of a wound where the edges are close together. When there is a gaping\nwound, it takes longer to refill the area with cells and collagen.

What is dense irregular elastic tissue?,"['Reticular tissue is a mesh-like, supportive framework for soft organs such as lymphatic tissue, the spleen, and the\nliver (Figure 4.14). Reticular cells produce the reticular fibers that form the network onto which other cells attach. It\nderives its name from the Latin reticulus, which means “little net.”\nFIGURE 4.14\nReticular Tissue\nThis is a loose connective tissue made up of a network of reticular fibers that provides a supportive\nframework for soft organs. LM × 1600. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)\nDense Connective Tissue\nDense connective tissue contains more collagen fibers than does loose connective tissue. As a consequence, it\ndisplays greater resistance to stretching. There are two major categories of dense connective tissue: regular and\nirregular. Dense regular connective tissue fibers are parallel to each other, enhancing tensile strength and resistance\nto stretching in the direction of the fiber orientations. Ligaments and tendons are made of dense regular connective\ntissue, but in ligaments not all fibers are parallel. Dense regular elastic tissue contains elastin fibers in addition to\ncollagen fibers, which allows the ligament to return to its original length after stretching. The ligaments in the vocal\nfolds and between the vertebrae in the vertebral column are elastic.\nIn dense irregular connective tissue, the direction of fibers is random. This arrangement gives the tissue greater\nstrength in all directions and less strength in one particular direction. In some tissues, fibers crisscross and form a\nmesh. In other tissues, stretching in several directions is achieved by alternating layers where fibers run in the same\n4.3 • Connective Tissue Supports and Protects\n143\norientation in each layer, and it is the layers themselves that are stacked at an angle.

As you toss the ball high in the air, a burning pain shoots across your wrist and you drop the\ntennis racket. That dull ache in the wrist that you ignored through the summer is now an unbearable pain. The\ngame is over for now.\nAfter examining your swollen wrist, the doctor in the emergency room announces that you have developed wrist\ntendinitis. She recommends icing the tender area, taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication to ease\nthe pain and to reduce swelling, and complete rest for a few weeks. She interrupts your protests that you cannot\nstop playing. She issues a stern warning about the risk of aggravating the condition and the possibility of surgery.\nShe consoles you by mentioning that well known tennis players such as Venus and Serena Williams and Rafael\nNadal have also suffered from tendinitis related injuries.\nWhat is tendinitis and how did it happen? Tendinitis is the inflammation of a tendon, the thick band of fibrous\nconnective tissue that attaches a muscle to a bone. The condition causes pain and tenderness in the area\naround a joint. On rare occasions, a sudden serious injury will cause tendinitis. Most often, the condition results\nfrom repetitive motions over time that strain the tendons needed to perform the tasks.\nPersons whose jobs and hobbies involve performing the same movements over and over again are often at the\ngreatest risk of tendinitis. You hear of tennis and golfer’s elbow, jumper's knee, and swimmer’s shoulder."", 'They originate in the mesodermal\ngerm layer and differentiate from mesenchyme and\nhematopoietic tissue in the bone marrow.

The extracellular matrix\ncontains fluid, proteins, polysaccharide derivatives,\nand, in the case of bone, mineral crystals. Protein fibers\nfall into three major groups: collagen fibers that are\nthick, strong, flexible, and resist stretch; reticular fibers\nthat are thin and form a supportive mesh; and elastin\nfibers that are thin and elastic.\nThe major types of connective tissue are connective\ntissue proper, supportive tissue, and fluid tissue. Loose\nconnective tissue proper includes adipose tissue,\nareolar tissue, and reticular tissue. These serve to hold\norgans and other tissues in place and, in the case of\nadipose tissue, isolate and store energy reserves. The\nmatrix is the most abundant feature for loose tissue\nalthough adipose tissue does not have much\nextracellular matrix. Dense connective tissue proper is\nricher in fibers and may be regular, with fibers oriented\nin parallel as in ligaments and tendons, or irregular,\nwith fibers oriented in several directions. Organ\ncapsules (collagenous type) and walls of arteries\n(elastic type) contain dense irregular connective tissue.\nCartilage and bone are supportive tissue. Cartilage\ncontains chondrocytes and is somewhat flexible.\nHyaline cartilage is smooth and clear, covers joints, and\nis found in the growing portion of bones. Fibrocartilage\nis tough because of extra collagen fibers and forms,\namong other things, the intervertebral discs. Elastic\ncartilage can stretch and recoil to its original shape\nbecause of its high content of elastic fibers. The matrix\ncontains very few blood vessels. Bones are made of a\nrigid, mineralized matrix containing calcium salts,\ncrystals, and osteocytes lodged in lacunae. Bone tissue\nis highly vascularized.', 'A layer of dense irregular connective tissue,\nthe perichondrium, encapsulates the cartilage. Cartilaginous tissue is avascular, thus all nutrients need to diffuse\nthrough the matrix to reach the chondrocytes. This is a factor contributing to the very slow healing of cartilaginous\ntissues.\nThe three main types of cartilage tissue are hyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage, and elastic cartilage (Figure 4.16).\nHyaline cartilage, the most common type of cartilage in the body, consists of short and dispersed collagen fibers\nand contains large amounts of proteoglycans. Under the microscope, tissue samples appear clear. The surface of\nhyaline cartilage is smooth. Both strong and flexible, it is found in the rib cage and nose and covers bones where\nthey meet to form moveable joints. It makes up a template of the embryonic skeleton before bone formation. A\nplate of hyaline cartilage at the ends of bone allows continued growth until adulthood. Fibrocartilage is tough\nbecause it has thick bundles of collagen fibers dispersed through its matrix. Menisci in the knee joint and the\nintervertebral discs are examples of fibrocartilage. Elastic cartilage contains elastic fibers as well as collagen and\nproteoglycans. This tissue gives rigid support as well as elasticity. Tug gently at your ear lobes, and notice that the\nlobes return to their initial shape. The external ear contains elastic cartilage.\nWhile older adults are at risk for tendinitis because the elasticity of tendon tissue decreases with age, active\npeople of all ages can develop tendinitis. Young athletes, dancers, and computer operators; anyone who\nperforms the same movements constantly is at risk for tendinitis. Although repetitive motions are unavoidable in\nmany activities and may lead to tendinitis, precautions can be taken that can lessen the probability of\ndeveloping tendinitis. For active individuals, stretches before exercising and cross training or changing exercises\nare recommended. For the passionate athlete, it may be time to take some lessons to improve technique. All of\nthe preventive measures aim to increase the strength of the tendon and decrease the stress put on it.

A second type of embryonic connective tissue forms in the umbilical cord,\ncalled mucous connective tissue or Wharton’s jelly. This tissue is no longer present after birth, leaving only\nscattered mesenchymal cells throughout the body.\nClassification of Connective Tissues\nThe three broad categories of connective tissue are classified according to the characteristics of their ground\nsubstance and the types of fibers found within the matrix (Table 4.1). Connective tissue proper includes loose\nconnective tissue and dense connective tissue. Both tissues have a variety of cell types and protein fibers\nsuspended in a viscous ground substance. Dense connective tissue is reinforced by bundles of fibers that provide\ntensile strength, elasticity, and protection. In loose connective tissue, the fibers are loosely organized, leaving large\nspaces in between. Supportive connective tissue—bone and cartilage—provide structure and strength to the body\nand protect soft tissues. A few distinct cell types and densely packed fibers in a matrix characterize these tissues. In\nbone, the matrix is rigid and described as calcified because of the deposited calcium salts. In fluid connective\ntissue, in other words, lymph and blood, various specialized cells circulate in a watery fluid containing salts,\nnutrients, and dissolved proteins.\nConnective Tissue Examples\nConnective tissue proper\nSupportive connective tissue\nFluid connective tissue\nLoose connective tissue\n•\nAreolar\n•\nAdipose\n•\nReticular\nDense connective tissue\n•\nDense regular\n•\nElastic\n•\nDense-irregular\nCartilage\n•\nHyaline\n•\nFibrocartilage\n•\nElastic\nBone\nBlood\nLymph\nTABLE 4.1\nConnective Tissue Proper\nFibroblasts are present in all connective tissue proper (Figure 4.12).']","Dense irregular elastic tissue is a type of connective tissue characterized by a random arrangement of collagen and elastin fibers, providing strength and elasticity in multiple directions.

Where is the dermis of the skin located?,"['The reticular layer appears\nreticulated (net-like) due to a tight meshwork of fibers. Elastin fibers provide some elasticity to the skin, enabling\nmovement. Collagen fibers provide structure and tensile strength, with strands of collagen extending into both the\npapillary layer and the hypodermis. In addition, collagen binds water to keep the skin hydrated. Collagen injections\nand Retin-A creams help restore skin turgor by either introducing collagen externally or stimulating blood flow and\nrepair of the dermis, respectively.\nHypodermis\nThe hypodermis (also called the subcutaneous layer or superficial fascia) is a layer directly below the dermis and\nserves to connect the skin to the underlying fascia (fibrous tissue) of the bones and muscles. It is not strictly a part\nof the skin, although the border between the hypodermis and dermis can be difficult to distinguish. The hypodermis\nconsists of well-vascularized, loose, areolar connective tissue and adipose tissue, which functions as a mode of fat\nstorage and provides insulation and cushioning for the integument.\n168\n5 • The Integumentary System\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nPigmentation\nThe color of skin is influenced by a number of pigments, including melanin, carotene, and hemoglobin. Recall that\nmelanin is produced by cells called melanocytes, which are found scattered throughout the stratum basale of the\nepidermis. The melanin is transferred into the keratinocytes via a cellular vesicle called a melanosome (Figure 5.8).\nEveryday Connection\nLipid Storage\nThe hypodermis is home to most of the fat that concerns people when they are trying to keep their weight under\ncontrol. Adipose tissue present in the hypodermis consists of fat-storing cells called adipocytes. This stored fat\ncan serve as an energy reserve, insulate the body to prevent heat loss, and act as a cushion to protect underlying\nstructures from trauma.\nWhere the fat is deposited and accumulates within the hypodermis depends on hormones (testosterone,\nestrogen, insulin, glucagon, leptin, and others), as well as genetic factors. Fat distribution changes as our bodies\nmature and age.', 'They also tend to be more sensitive to light and\nhave vision problems due to the lack of pigmentation on the retinal wall. Treatment of this disorder usually\ninvolves addressing the symptoms, such as limiting UV light exposure to the skin and eyes. In vitiligo, the\nmelanocytes in certain areas lose their ability to produce melanin, possibly due to an autoimmune reaction. This\nleads to a loss of color in patches (Figure 5.10). Neither albinism nor vitiligo directly affects the lifespan of an\nindividual.\n5.1 • Layers of the Skin\n171\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nThis ABC video follows the story of a pair of fraternal African-American twins, one of whom is albino.

These structures\nembryologically originate from the epidermis and can extend down through the dermis into the hypodermis.\nHair\nHair is a keratinous filament growing out of the epidermis. It is primarily made of dead, keratinized cells. Strands of\nhair originate in an epidermal penetration of the dermis called the hair follicle. The hair shaft is the part of the hair\nnot anchored to the follicle, and much of this is exposed at the skin’s surface.

The lateral nail fold overlaps the nail on the sides, helping to anchor the nail body. The\nnail fold that meets the proximal end of the nail body forms the nail cuticle, also called the eponychium. The nail\nbed is rich in blood vessels, making it appear pink, except at the base, where a thick layer of epithelium over the nail\nmatrix forms a crescent-shaped region called the lunula (the “little moon”). The area beneath the free edge of the\nnail, furthest from the cuticle, is called the hyponychium.

Sweat glands develop from\nepidermal projections into the dermis and are classified as merocrine glands; that is, the secretions are excreted by\n5.2 • Accessory Structures of the Skin\n175\nexocytosis through a duct without affecting the cells of the gland. There are two types of sweat glands, each\nsecreting slightly different products.\nAn eccrine sweat gland is type of gland that produces a hypotonic sweat for thermoregulation. These glands are\nfound all over the skin’s surface, but are especially abundant on the palms of the hand, the soles of the feet, and the\nforehead (Figure 5.14). They are coiled glands lying deep in the dermis, with the duct rising up to a pore on the skin\nsurface, where the sweat is released.', 'The topmost\nlayer, the stratum corneum, consists of dead cells that\nshed periodically and is progressively replaced by cells\nformed from the basal layer. The stratum basale also\ncontains melanocytes, cells that produce melanin, the\npigment primarily responsible for giving skin its color.\nMelanin is transferred to keratinocytes in the stratum\nspinosum to protect cells from UV rays.\nThe dermis connects the epidermis to the hypodermis,\nand provides strength and elasticity due to the\npresence of collagen and elastin fibers. It has only two\nlayers: the papillary layer with papillae that extend into\nthe epidermis and the lower, reticular layer composed\nof loose connective tissue. The hypodermis, deep to\nthe dermis of skin, is the connective tissue that\nconnects the dermis to underlying structures; it also\nharbors adipose tissue for fat storage and protection.\n5.2 Accessory Structures of the Skin\nAccessory structures of the skin include hair, nails,\nsweat glands, and sebaceous glands. Hair is made of\n5 • Chapter Review\n187\ndead keratinized cells, and gets its color from melanin\npigments. Nails, also made of dead keratinized cells,\nprotect the extremities of our fingers and toes from\nmechanical damage. Sweat glands and sebaceous\nglands produce sweat and sebum, respectively. Each of\nthese fluids has a role to play in maintaining\nhomeostasis. Sweat cools the body surface when it\ngets overheated and helps excrete small amounts of\nmetabolic waste. Sebum acts as a natural moisturizer\nand keeps the dead, flaky, outer keratin layer healthy.\n5.3 Functions of the Integumentary System\nThe skin plays important roles in protection, sensing\nstimuli, thermoregulation, and vitamin D synthesis. It is\nthe first layer of defense to prevent dehydration,\ninfection, and injury to the rest of the body. Sweat\nglands in the skin allow the skin surface to cool when\nthe body gets overheated. Thermoregulation is also\naccomplished by the dilation or constriction of heat-\ncarrying blood vessels in the skin.']","The dermis is located between the epidermis, which is the outermost layer of the skin, and the hypodermis, or subcutaneous layer, which connects the skin to underlying structures such as bones and muscles.","The dermis of the skin is an example of dense irregular connective tissue rich in collagen fibers, located in the skin."

A ribosome is an organelle that serves as the site of protein synthesis. It is composed of two\nribosomal RNA subunits that wrap around mRNA to start the process of translation, followed by protein synthesis.\nSmooth ER (SER) lacks these ribosomes.\nOne of the main functions of the smooth ER is in the synthesis of lipids. The smooth ER synthesizes phospholipids,\nthe main component of biological membranes, as well as steroid hormones. For this reason, cells that produce large\nquantities of such hormones, such as those of the female ovaries and male testes, contain large amounts of smooth\nER. In addition to lipid synthesis, the smooth ER also sequesters (i.e., stores) and regulates the concentration of\ncellular Ca++, a function extremely important in cells of the nervous system where Ca++ is the trigger for\nneurotransmitter release. The smooth ER additionally metabolizes some carbohydrates and performs a\ndetoxification role, breaking down certain toxins.\nIn contrast with the smooth ER, the primary job of the rough ER is the synthesis and modification of proteins\ndestined for the cell membrane or for export from the cell. For this protein synthesis, many ribosomes attach to the\nER (giving it the studded appearance of rough ER). Typically, a protein is synthesized within the ribosome and\nreleased inside the channel of the rough ER, where sugars can be added to it (by a process called glycosylation)\nbefore it is transported within a vesicle to the next stage in the packaging and shipping process: the Golgi apparatus.\nThe Golgi Apparatus\nThe Golgi apparatus is responsible for sorting, modifying, and shipping off the products that come from the rough\n3.2 • The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles\n93\nER, much like a post-office.

Cell differentiation is the process\nof cells becoming specialized as they body develops. A\nstem cell is an unspecialized cell that can divide\nwithout limit as needed and can, under specific\nconditions, differentiate into specialized cells. Stem\ncells are divided into several categories according to\ntheir potential to differentiate. While all somatic cells\ncontain the exact same genome, different cell types\nonly express some of those genes at any given time.\nThese differences in gene expression ultimately dictate\na cell’s unique morphological and physiological\ncharacteristics. The primary mechanism that\ndetermines which genes will be expressed and which\nones will not is through the use of different\ntranscription factor proteins, which bind to DNA and\npromote or hinder the transcription of different genes.\nThrough the action of these transcription factors, cells\nspecialize into one of hundreds of different cell types in\nthe human body.\nInteractive Link Questions\n1.

It typically arises from cells that have undergone malignant transformation, leading to uncontrolled growth and the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize to other parts of the body.",Cancers derived from epithelial cells are referred to as carcinomas.
Where are sarcomas derived from?,"['HOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCES\nTissues and Cancer\nCancer is a generic term for many diseases in which cells escape regulatory signals. Uncontrolled growth, invasion\ninto adjacent tissues, and colonization of other organs, if not treated early enough, are its hallmarks. Health suffers\nwhen tumors “rob” blood supply from the “normal” organs.\nA mutation is defined as a permanent change in the DNA of a cell. Epigenetic modifications, changes that do not\naffect the code of the DNA but alter how the DNA is decoded, are also known to generate abnormal cells. Alterations\nin the genetic material may be caused by environmental agents, infectious agents, or errors in the replication of DNA\nthat accumulate with age. Many mutations do not cause any noticeable change in the functions of a cell. However, if\nthe modification affects key proteins that have an impact on the cell’s ability to proliferate in an orderly fashion, the\ncell starts to divide abnormally. As changes in cells accumulate, they lose their ability to form regular tissues. A\ntumor, a mass of cells displaying abnormal architecture, forms in the tissue. Many tumors are benign, meaning they\ndo not metastasize nor cause disease. A tumor becomes malignant, or cancerous, when it breaches the confines of\nits tissue, promotes angiogenesis, attracts the growth of capillaries, and metastasizes to other organs (Figure 4.22).\nThe specific names of cancers reflect the tissue of origin. Cancers derived from epithelial cells are referred to as\ncarcinomas. Cancer in myeloid tissue or blood cells form myelomas. Leukemias are cancers of white blood cells,\nwhereas sarcomas derive from connective tissue. Cells in tumors differ both in structure and function. Some cells,\ncalled cancer stem cells, appear to be a subtype of cell responsible for uncontrolled growth. Recent research shows\nthat contrary to what was previously assumed, tumors are not disorganized masses of cells, but have their own\nstructures.\n4.6 • Tissue Injury and Aging\n153\nFIGURE 4.22\nDevelopment of Cancer\nNote the change in cell size, nucleus size, and organization in the tissue.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/tumor) to learn more about tumors. What is a tumor?', 'Once the wall is in place, it\nstores potential energy. Potential energy is the energy of position, or the energy matter possesses because of the\npositioning or structure of its components. If the brick wall collapses, the stored potential energy is released as\nkinetic energy as the bricks fall.\nIn the human body, potential energy is stored in the bonds between atoms and molecules. Chemical energy is the\nform of potential energy in which energy is stored in chemical bonds. When those bonds are formed, chemical\nenergy is invested, and when they break, chemical energy is released. Notice that chemical energy, like all energy, is\nneither created nor destroyed; rather, it is converted from one form to another. When you eat an energy bar before\nheading out the door for a hike, the honey, nuts, and other foods the bar contains are broken down and rearranged\nby your body into molecules that your muscle cells convert to kinetic energy.\n2.3 • Chemical Reactions\n51\nChemical reactions that release more energy than they absorb are characterized as exergonic. The catabolism of the\nfoods in your energy bar is an example. Some of the chemical energy stored in the bar is absorbed into molecules\nyour body uses for fuel, but some of it is released—for example, as heat. In contrast, chemical reactions that absorb\nmore energy than they release are endergonic. These reactions require energy input, and the resulting molecule\nstores not only the chemical energy in the original components, but also the energy that fueled the reaction.\nBecause energy is neither created nor destroyed, where does the energy needed for endergonic reactions come\nfrom? In many cases, it comes from exergonic reactions.\nForms of Energy Important in Human Functioning\nYou have already learned that chemical energy is absorbed, stored, and released by chemical bonds. In addition to\nchemical energy, mechanical, radiant, and electrical energy are important in human functioning.\n•\nMechanical energy, which is stored in physical systems such as machines, engines, or the human body, directly\npowers the movement of matter. When you lift a brick into place on a wall, your muscles provide the mechanical\nenergy that moves the brick.\n•\nRadiant energy is energy emitted and transmitted as waves rather than matter. These waves vary in length from\nlong radio waves and microwaves to short gamma waves emitted from decaying atomic nuclei.', 'The third\nbinding site on the glycerol is taken up by the phosphate group, which in turn is attached to a polar “head” region of\nthe molecule. Recall that triglycerides are nonpolar and hydrophobic. This still holds for the fatty acid portion of a\nphospholipid compound. However, the head of a phospholipid contains charges on the phosphate groups, as well as\non the nitrogen atom. These charges make the phospholipid head hydrophilic. Therefore, phospholipids are said to\nhave hydrophobic tails, containing the neutral fatty acids, and hydrophilic heads, containing the charged phosphate\ngroups and nitrogen atom.\nFIGURE 2.23\nOther Important Lipids\n(a) Phospholipids are composed of two fatty acids, glycerol, and a phosphate group.

Like other lipids, cholesterol’s\nhydrocarbons make it hydrophobic; however, it has a polar hydroxyl head that is hydrophilic. Cholesterol is an\nimportant component of bile acids, compounds that help emulsify dietary fats. In fact, the word root chole- refers to\nbile. Cholesterol is also a building block of many hormones, signaling molecules that the body releases to regulate\nprocesses at distant sites. Finally, like phospholipids, cholesterol molecules are found in the cell membrane, where\ntheir hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions help regulate the flow of substances into and out of the cell.', 'An object’s weight, on the other hand, is its mass as\naffected by the pull of gravity. Where gravity strongly pulls on an object’s mass its weight is greater than it is where\ngravity is less strong. An object of a certain mass weighs less on the moon, for example, than it does on Earth\nbecause the gravity of the moon is less than that of Earth. In other words, weight is variable, and is influenced by\ngravity. A piece of cheese that weighs a pound on Earth weighs only a few ounces on the moon.\nElements and Compounds\nAll matter in the natural world is composed of one or more of the 92 fundamental substances called elements. An\nelement is a pure substance that is distinguished from all other matter by the fact that it cannot be created or\nbroken down by ordinary chemical means. While your body can assemble many of the chemical compounds needed\nfor life from their constituent elements, it cannot make elements. They must come from the environment. A familiar\nexample of an element that you must take in is calcium (Ca). Calcium is essential to the human body; it is absorbed\nand used for a number of processes, including strengthening bones. When you consume dairy products your\ndigestive system breaks down the food into components small enough to cross into the bloodstream. Among these\nis calcium, which, because it is an element, cannot be broken down further. The elemental calcium in cheese,\ntherefore, is the same as the calcium that forms your bones. Some other elements you might be familiar with are\noxygen, sodium, and iron. The elements in the human body are shown in Figure 2.2, beginning with the most\nabundant: oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N). Each element’s name can be replaced by a one- or\ntwo-letter symbol; you will become familiar with some of these during this course.

One reason that the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish are beneficial is\nthat they stimulate the production of certain prostaglandins that help regulate aspects of blood pressure and\ninflammation, and thereby reduce the risk for heart disease. Prostaglandins also sensitize nerves to pain. One class\nof pain-relieving medications called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) works by reducing the effects of\nprostaglandins.\nProteins\nYou might associate proteins with muscle tissue, but in fact, proteins are critical components of all tissues and\norgans. A protein is an organic molecule composed of amino acids linked by peptide bonds. Proteins include the\nkeratin in the epidermis of skin that protects underlying tissues, the collagen found in the dermis of skin, in bones,\nand in the meninges that cover the brain and spinal cord. Proteins are also components of many of the body’s\nfunctional chemicals, including digestive enzymes in the digestive tract, antibodies, the neurotransmitters that\nneurons use to communicate with other cells, and the peptide-based hormones that regulate certain body functions\n(for instance, growth hormone).

Most\nglands consist of groups of epithelial cells. A gland can be classified as an endocrine gland, a ductless gland that\nreleases secretions directly into surrounding tissues and fluids (endo- = “inside”), or an exocrine gland whose\nsecretions leave through a duct that opens directly, or indirectly, to the external environment (exo- = “outside”).\nEndocrine Glands\nThe secretions of endocrine glands are called hormones. Hormones are released into the interstitial fluid, diffused\ninto the bloodstream, and delivered to targets, in other words, cells that have receptors to bind the hormones. The\nendocrine system is part of a major regulatory system coordinating the regulation and integration of body\nresponses. A few examples of endocrine glands include the anterior pituitary, thymus, adrenal cortex, and gonads.\nExocrine Glands\nExocrine glands release their contents through a duct that leads to the epithelial surface. Mucous, sweat, saliva, and\nbreast milk are all examples of secretions from exocrine glands. They are all discharged through tubular ducts.\nSecretions into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, technically outside of the body, are of the exocrine category.', 'A few examples of endocrine glands include the anterior pituitary, thymus, adrenal cortex, and gonads.\nExocrine Glands\nExocrine glands release their contents through a duct that leads to the epithelial surface.

They are all discharged through tubular ducts.\nSecretions into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, technically outside of the body, are of the exocrine category.\nGlandular Structure\nExocrine glands are classified as either unicellular or multicellular. The unicellular glands are scattered single cells,\nsuch as goblet cells, found in the mucous membranes of the small and large intestine.\nThe multicellular exocrine glands known as serous glands develop from simple epithelium to form a secretory\nsurface that secretes directly into an inner cavity. These glands line the internal cavities of the abdomen and chest\nand release their secretions directly into the cavities. Other multicellular exocrine glands release their contents\nthrough a tubular duct. The duct is single in a simple gland but in compound glands is divided into one or more\nbranches (Figure 4.9). In tubular glands, the ducts can be straight or coiled, whereas tubes that form pockets are\nalveolar (acinar), such as the exocrine portion of the pancreas. Combinations of tubes and pockets are known as\ntubuloalveolar (tubuloacinar) compound glands. In a branched gland, a duct is connected to more than one\nsecretory group of cells.\n4.2 • Epithelial Tissue\n137\nFIGURE 4.9\nTypes of Exocrine Glands\nExocrine glands are classified by their structure.\nMethods and Types of Secretion\nExocrine glands can be classified by their mode of secretion and the nature of the substances released, as well as by\nthe structure of the glands and shape of ducts (Figure 4.10). Merocrine secretion is the most common type of\nexocrine secretion. The secretions are enclosed in vesicles that move to the apical surface of the cell where the\ncontents are released by exocytosis.

Epithelium also forms much of the glandular tissue of the body. Skin\nis not the only area of the body exposed to the outside. Other areas include the airways, the digestive tract, as well\nas the urinary and reproductive systems, all of which are lined by an epithelium. Hollow organs and body cavities\nthat do not connect to the exterior of the body, which includes, blood vessels and serous membranes, are lined by\nendothelium (plural = endothelia), which is a type of epithelium.\nEpithelial cells derive from all three major embryonic layers. The epithelia lining the skin, parts of the mouth and\nnose, and the anus develop from the ectoderm. Cells lining the airways and most of the digestive system originate in\nthe endoderm. The epithelium that lines vessels in the lymphatic and cardiovascular system derives from the\nmesoderm and is called an endothelium.\nAll epithelia share some important structural and functional features.

When there is a gaping\nwound, it takes longer to refill the area with cells and collagen. The process called secondary union occurs as the\nedges of the wound are pulled together by what is called wound contraction. When a wound is more than one\nquarter of an inch deep, sutures (stitches) are recommended to promote a primary union and avoid the formation of\na disfiguring scar.

All the cells, tissues, and organs are affected by senescence, with noticeable variability\nbetween individuals owing to different genetic makeup and lifestyles. The outward signs of aging are easily\nrecognizable. The skin and other tissues become thinner and drier, reducing their elasticity, contributing to wrinkles\nand high blood pressure. Hair turns gray because follicles produce less melanin, the brown pigment of hair and the\niris of the eye. The face looks flabby because elastic and collagen fibers decrease in connective tissue and muscle\ntone is lost. Glasses and hearing aids may become parts of life as the senses slowly deteriorate, all due to reduced\nelasticity. Overall height decreases as the bones lose calcium and other minerals. With age, fluid decreases in the\nfibrous cartilage disks intercalated between the vertebrae in the spine. Joints lose cartilage and stiffen. Many\ntissues, including those in muscles, lose mass through a process called atrophy. Lumps and rigidity become more\nwidespread. As a consequence, the passageways, blood vessels, and airways become more rigid. The brain and\nspinal cord lose mass. Nerves do not transmit impulses with the same speed and frequency as in the past.']","The primary difference between exocrine and endocrine glands is that exocrine glands release their secretions through ducts to an epithelial surface or the external environment, while endocrine glands are ductless and release hormones directly into the bloodstream or surrounding tissues.","Exocrine glands release their products through ducts, whereas endocrine glands secrete hormones directly into the interstitial fluid and bloodstream."

Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream. Glands are classified both according to the\ntype of secretion and by their structure. Merocrine\nglands secrete products as they are synthesized.\nApocrine glands release secretions by pinching off the\napical portion of the cell, whereas holocrine gland cells\nstore their secretions until they rupture and release\ntheir contents.

A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands. Connective tissue, as its name implies, binds the\ncells and organs of the body together and functions in the protection, support, and integration of all parts of the\nbody. Muscle tissue is excitable, responding to stimulation and contracting to provide movement, and occurs as\nthree major types: skeletal (voluntary) muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle in the heart. Nervous tissue is\nalso excitable, allowing the propagation of electrochemical signals in the form of nerve impulses that communicate\nbetween different regions of the body (Figure 4.2).\nThe next level of organization is the organ, where several types of tissues come together to form a working unit. Just\nas knowing the structure and function of cells helps you in your study of tissues, knowledge of tissues will help you\nunderstand how organs function.

(Micrographs provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School ©\n2012)\nEmbryonic Origin of Tissues\nThe zygote, or fertilized egg, is a single cell formed by the fusion of an egg and sperm. After fertilization the zygote\ngives rise to rapid mitotic cycles, generating many cells to form the embryo. The first embryonic cells generated\nhave the ability to differentiate into any type of cell in the body and, as such, are called totipotent, meaning each\nhas the capacity to divide, differentiate, and develop into a new organism.', 'A primary union describes the healing of a wound where the edges are close together. When there is a gaping\nwound, it takes longer to refill the area with cells and collagen. The process called secondary union occurs as the\nedges of the wound are pulled together by what is called wound contraction. When a wound is more than one\nquarter of an inch deep, sutures (stitches) are recommended to promote a primary union and avoid the formation of\na disfiguring scar. Regeneration is the addition of new cells of the same type as the ones that were injured (Figure\n4.21).\nFIGURE 4.21\nTissue Healing\nDuring wound repair, collagen fibers are laid down randomly by fibroblasts that move into repair the area.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/healingskin) to see the skin healing process. What is the process and how \nlong does it take?\nTissue and Aging\nAccording to poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, “The surest poison is time.” In fact, biology confirms that many functions\nof the body decline with age. All the cells, tissues, and organs are affected by senescence, with noticeable variability\nbetween individuals owing to different genetic makeup and lifestyles. The outward signs of aging are easily\nrecognizable. The skin and other tissues become thinner and drier, reducing their elasticity, contributing to wrinkles\nand high blood pressure. Hair turns gray because follicles produce less melanin, the brown pigment of hair and the\niris of the eye. The face looks flabby because elastic and collagen fibers decrease in connective tissue and muscle\ntone is lost. Glasses and hearing aids may become parts of life as the senses slowly deteriorate, all due to reduced\nelasticity. Overall height decreases as the bones lose calcium and other minerals. With age, fluid decreases in the\nfibrous cartilage disks intercalated between the vertebrae in the spine. Joints lose cartilage and stiffen. Many\ntissues, including those in muscles, lose mass through a process called atrophy. Lumps and rigidity become more\nwidespread. As a consequence, the passageways, blood vessels, and airways become more rigid. The brain and\nspinal cord lose mass. Nerves do not transmit impulses with the same speed and frequency as in the past.', 'In a growing fetus, fingerprints form where the cells of the stratum basale meet the papillae of the underlying\ndermal layer (papillary layer), resulting in the formation of the ridges on your fingers that you recognize as\nfingerprints. Fingerprints are unique to each individual and are used for forensic analyses because the patterns do\nnot change with the growth and aging processes.\nStratum Spinosum\nAs the name suggests, the stratum spinosum is spiny in appearance due to the protruding cell processes that join\nthe cells via a structure called a desmosome. The desmosomes interlock with each other and strengthen the bond\nbetween the cells. It is interesting to note that the “spiny” nature of this layer is an artifact of the staining process.\nUnstained epidermis samples do not exhibit this characteristic appearance. The stratum spinosum is composed of\neight to 10 layers of keratinocytes, formed as a result of cell division in the stratum basale (Figure 5.6). Interspersed\namong the keratinocytes of this layer is a type of dendritic cell called the Langerhans cell, which functions as a\nmacrophage by engulfing bacteria, foreign particles, and damaged cells that occur in this layer.\nFIGURE 5.6\nCells of the Epidermis\nThe cells in the different layers of the epidermis originate from basal cells located in the stratum\nbasale, yet the cells of each layer are distinctively different.

Organic compounds are\nsynthesized via covalent bonds within living organisms, including the human body. Recall that carbon and\nhydrogen are the second and third most abundant elements in your body. You will soon discover how these two\nelements combine in the foods you eat, in the compounds that make up your body structure, and in the\nchemicals that fuel your functioning.\nThe following section examines the three groups of inorganic compounds essential to life: water, salts, acids, and\nbases. Organic compounds are covered later in the chapter.\nWater\nAs much as 70 percent of an adult’s body weight is water. This water is contained both within the cells and between\nthe cells that make up tissues and organs. Its several roles make water indispensable to human functioning.\nWater as a Lubricant and Cushion\nWater is a major component of many of the body’s lubricating fluids. Just as oil lubricates the hinge on a door, water\nin synovial fluid lubricates the actions of body joints, and water in pleural fluid helps the lungs expand and recoil\nwith breathing. Watery fluids help keep food flowing through the digestive tract, and ensure that the movement of\nadjacent abdominal organs is friction free.\nWater also protects cells and organs from physical trauma, cushioning the brain within the skull, for example, and\nprotecting the delicate nerve tissue of the eyes. Water cushions a developing fetus in the mother’s womb as well.\nWater as a Heat Sink\nA heat sink is a substance or object that absorbs and dissipates heat but does not experience a corresponding\nincrease in temperature. In the body, water absorbs the heat generated by chemical reactions without greatly\nincreasing in temperature. Moreover, when the environmental temperature soars, the water stored in the body helps\nkeep the body cool. This cooling effect happens as warm blood from the body’s core flows to the blood vessels just\nunder the skin and is transferred to the environment. At the same time, sweat glands release warm water in sweat.\nAs the water evaporates into the air, it carries away heat, and then the cooler blood from the periphery circulates\nback to the body core.', 'An object’s weight, on the other hand, is its mass as\naffected by the pull of gravity. Where gravity strongly pulls on an object’s mass its weight is greater than it is where\ngravity is less strong. An object of a certain mass weighs less on the moon, for example, than it does on Earth\nbecause the gravity of the moon is less than that of Earth. In other words, weight is variable, and is influenced by\ngravity. A piece of cheese that weighs a pound on Earth weighs only a few ounces on the moon.\nElements and Compounds\nAll matter in the natural world is composed of one or more of the 92 fundamental substances called elements. An\nelement is a pure substance that is distinguished from all other matter by the fact that it cannot be created or\nbroken down by ordinary chemical means. While your body can assemble many of the chemical compounds needed\nfor life from their constituent elements, it cannot make elements. They must come from the environment. A familiar\nexample of an element that you must take in is calcium (Ca). Calcium is essential to the human body; it is absorbed\nand used for a number of processes, including strengthening bones. When you consume dairy products your\ndigestive system breaks down the food into components small enough to cross into the bloodstream. Among these\nis calcium, which, because it is an element, cannot be broken down further. The elemental calcium in cheese,\ntherefore, is the same as the calcium that forms your bones. Some other elements you might be familiar with are\noxygen, sodium, and iron. The elements in the human body are shown in Figure 2.2, beginning with the most\nabundant: oxygen (O), carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and nitrogen (N). Each element’s name can be replaced by a one- or\ntwo-letter symbol; you will become familiar with some of these during this course. All the elements in your body are\nderived from the foods you eat and the air you breathe.\nFIGURE 2.2\nElements of the Human Body\nThe main elements that compose the human body are shown from most abundant to least\nabundant.\n40\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nIn nature, elements rarely occur alone.

The dermal papillae extending into the epidermis belong to the papillary layer, whereas the dense collagen fiber\nbundles below belong to the reticular layer. LM × 10. (credit: modification of work by “kilbad”/Wikimedia Commons)\nPapillary Layer\nThe papillary layer is made of loose, areolar connective tissue, which means the collagen and elastin fibers of this\nlayer form a loose mesh. This superficial layer of the dermis projects into the stratum basale of the epidermis to\nform finger-like dermal papillae (see Figure 5.7). Within the papillary layer are fibroblasts, a small number of fat\ncells (adipocytes), and an abundance of small blood vessels. In addition, the papillary layer contains phagocytes,\ndefensive cells that help fight bacteria or other infections that have breached the skin. This layer also contains\nlymphatic capillaries, nerve fibers, and touch receptors called the Meissner corpuscles.\nReticular Layer\nUnderlying the papillary layer is the much thicker reticular layer, composed of dense, irregular connective tissue.\nThis layer is well vascularized and has a rich sensory and sympathetic nerve supply. The reticular layer appears\nreticulated (net-like) due to a tight meshwork of fibers. Elastin fibers provide some elasticity to the skin, enabling\nmovement. Collagen fibers provide structure and tensile strength, with strands of collagen extending into both the\npapillary layer and the hypodermis. In addition, collagen binds water to keep the skin hydrated. Collagen injections\nand Retin-A creams help restore skin turgor by either introducing collagen externally or stimulating blood flow and\nrepair of the dermis, respectively.', 'Reticular tissue is a mesh-like, supportive framework for soft organs such as lymphatic tissue, the spleen, and the\nliver (Figure 4.14). Reticular cells produce the reticular fibers that form the network onto which other cells attach. It\nderives its name from the Latin reticulus, which means “little net.”\nFIGURE 4.14\nReticular Tissue\nThis is a loose connective tissue made up of a network of reticular fibers that provides a supportive\nframework for soft organs. LM × 1600. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)\nDense Connective Tissue\nDense connective tissue contains more collagen fibers than does loose connective tissue. As a consequence, it\ndisplays greater resistance to stretching. There are two major categories of dense connective tissue: regular and\nirregular. Dense regular connective tissue fibers are parallel to each other, enhancing tensile strength and resistance\nto stretching in the direction of the fiber orientations. Ligaments and tendons are made of dense regular connective\ntissue, but in ligaments not all fibers are parallel. Dense regular elastic tissue contains elastin fibers in addition to\ncollagen fibers, which allows the ligament to return to its original length after stretching. The ligaments in the vocal\nfolds and between the vertebrae in the vertebral column are elastic.\nIn dense irregular connective tissue, the direction of fibers is random. This arrangement gives the tissue greater\nstrength in all directions and less strength in one particular direction. In some tissues, fibers crisscross and form a\nmesh. In other tissues, stretching in several directions is achieved by alternating layers where fibers run in the same\n4.3 • Connective Tissue Supports and Protects\n143\norientation in each layer, and it is the layers themselves that are stacked at an angle. The dermis of the skin is an\nexample of dense irregular connective tissue rich in collagen fibers. Dense irregular elastic tissues give arterial walls\nthe strength and the ability to regain original shape after stretching (Figure 4.15).\nFIGURE 4.15\nDense Connective Tissue\n(a) Dense regular connective tissue consists of collagenous fibers packed into parallel bundles.', 'The number and type of adipocytes\ndepends on the tissue and location, and vary among individuals in the population.\nThe mesenchymal cell is a multipotent adult stem cell. These cells can differentiate into any type of connective\ntissue cells needed for repair and healing of damaged tissue.\nThe macrophage cell is a large cell derived from a monocyte, a type of blood cell, which enters the connective tissue\nmatrix from the blood vessels. The macrophage cells are an essential component of the immune system, which is\nthe body’s defense against potential pathogens and degraded host cells. When stimulated, macrophages release\ncytokines, small proteins that act as chemical messengers. Cytokines recruit other cells of the immune system to\ninfected sites and stimulate their activities. Roaming, or free, macrophages move rapidly by amoeboid movement,\nengulfing infectious agents and cellular debris. In contrast, fixed macrophages are permanent residents of their\ntissues.\nThe mast cell, found in connective tissue proper, has many cytoplasmic granules. These granules contain the\nchemical signals histamine and heparin. When irritated or damaged, mast cells release histamine, an inflammatory\nmediator, which causes vasodilation and increased blood flow at a site of injury or infection, along with itching,\nswelling, and redness you recognize as an allergic response. Like blood cells, mast cells are derived from\nhematopoietic stem cells and are part of the immune system.\nConnective Tissue Fibers and Ground Substance\nThree main types of fibers are secreted by fibroblasts: collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers. Collagen\nfiber is made from fibrous protein subunits linked together to form a long and straight fiber. Collagen fibers, while\nflexible, have great tensile strength, resist stretching, and give ligaments and tendons their characteristic resilience\nand strength. These fibers hold connective tissues together, even during the movement of the body.\nElastic fiber contains the protein elastin along with lesser amounts of other proteins and glycoproteins. The main\nproperty of elastin is that after being stretched or compressed, it will return to its original shape. Elastic fibers are\nprominent in elastic tissues found in skin and the elastic ligaments of the vertebral column.', 'They originate in the mesodermal\ngerm layer and differentiate from mesenchyme and\nhematopoietic tissue in the bone marrow.

Where is the hypodermis located in relation to the dermis?,"['The reticular layer appears\nreticulated (net-like) due to a tight meshwork of fibers. Elastin fibers provide some elasticity to the skin, enabling\nmovement. Collagen fibers provide structure and tensile strength, with strands of collagen extending into both the\npapillary layer and the hypodermis. In addition, collagen binds water to keep the skin hydrated. Collagen injections\nand Retin-A creams help restore skin turgor by either introducing collagen externally or stimulating blood flow and\nrepair of the dermis, respectively.\nHypodermis\nThe hypodermis (also called the subcutaneous layer or superficial fascia) is a layer directly below the dermis and\nserves to connect the skin to the underlying fascia (fibrous tissue) of the bones and muscles. It is not strictly a part\nof the skin, although the border between the hypodermis and dermis can be difficult to distinguish. The hypodermis\nconsists of well-vascularized, loose, areolar connective tissue and adipose tissue, which functions as a mode of fat\nstorage and provides insulation and cushioning for the integument.\n168\n5 • The Integumentary System\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nPigmentation\nThe color of skin is influenced by a number of pigments, including melanin, carotene, and hemoglobin. Recall that\nmelanin is produced by cells called melanocytes, which are found scattered throughout the stratum basale of the\nepidermis. The melanin is transferred into the keratinocytes via a cellular vesicle called a melanosome (Figure 5.8).\nEveryday Connection\nLipid Storage\nThe hypodermis is home to most of the fat that concerns people when they are trying to keep their weight under\ncontrol. Adipose tissue present in the hypodermis consists of fat-storing cells called adipocytes. This stored fat\ncan serve as an energy reserve, insulate the body to prevent heat loss, and act as a cushion to protect underlying\nstructures from trauma.\nWhere the fat is deposited and accumulates within the hypodermis depends on hormones (testosterone,\nestrogen, insulin, glucagon, leptin, and others), as well as genetic factors. Fat distribution changes as our bodies\nmature and age.', 'Adipose tissue present in the hypodermis consists of fat-storing cells called adipocytes.

Fat distribution changes as our bodies\nmature and age. Males tend to accumulate fat in different areas (neck, arms, lower back, and abdomen) than do\nfemales (breasts, hips, thighs, and buttocks). The body mass index (BMI) is often used as a measure of fat,\nalthough this measure is, in fact, derived from a mathematical formula that compares body weight (mass) to\nheight. Therefore, its accuracy as a health indicator can be called into question in individuals who are extremely\nphysically fit.\nIn many animals, there is a pattern of storing excess calories as fat to be used in times when food is not readily\navailable. In much of the developed world, insufficient exercise coupled with the ready availability and\nconsumption of high-calorie foods have resulted in unwanted accumulations of adipose tissue in many people.\nAlthough periodic accumulation of excess fat may have provided an evolutionary advantage to our ancestors,\nwho experienced unpredictable bouts of famine, it is now becoming chronic and considered a major health\nthreat. Recent studies indicate that a distressing percentage of our population is overweight and/or clinically\nobese. Not only is this a problem for the individuals affected, but it also has a severe impact on our healthcare\nsystem. Changes in lifestyle, specifically in diet and exercise, are the best ways to control body fat accumulation,\nespecially when it reaches levels that increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes.\n5.1 • Layers of the Skin\n169\nFIGURE 5.8\nSkin Pigmentation\nThe relative coloration of the skin depends of the amount of melanin produced by melanocytes in the\nstratum basale and taken up by keratinocytes.\nMelanin occurs in two primary forms. Eumelanin exists as black and brown, whereas pheomelanin provides a red\ncolor. Dark-skinned individuals produce more melanin than those with pale skin.', 'Transitional describes a form of specialized\nstratified epithelium in which the shape of the cells can vary.\nFIGURE 4.6\nCells of Epithelial Tissue\nSimple epithelial tissue is organized as a single layer of cells and stratified epithelial tissue is\nformed by several layers of cells.\nSimple Epithelium\nThe shape of the cells in the single cell layer of simple epithelium reflects the functioning of those cells. The cells in\nsimple squamous epithelium have the appearance of thin scales. Squamous cell nuclei tend to be flat, horizontal,\nand elliptical, mirroring the form of the cell. The endothelium is the epithelial tissue that lines vessels of the\nlymphatic and cardiovascular system, and it is made up of a single layer of squamous cells. Simple squamous\nepithelium, because of the thinness of the cell, is present where rapid passage of chemical compounds is observed.\nThe alveoli of lungs where gases diffuse, segments of kidney tubules, and the lining of capillaries are also made of\nsimple squamous epithelial tissue. The mesothelium is a simple squamous epithelium that forms the surface layer\nof the serous membrane that lines body cavities and internal organs. Its primary function is to provide a smooth and\nprotective surface. Mesothelial cells are squamous epithelial cells that secrete a fluid that lubricates the\nmesothelium.\nIn simple cuboidal epithelium, the nucleus of the box-like cells appears round and is generally located near the\ncenter of the cell. These epithelia are active in the secretion and absorptions of molecules. Simple cuboidal epithelia\n4.2 • Epithelial Tissue\n133\nare observed in the lining of the kidney tubules and in the ducts of glands.\nIn simple columnar epithelium, the nucleus of the tall column-like cells tends to be elongated and located in the\nbasal end of the cells.

In pseudostratified epithelium, nuclei of\nneighboring cells appear at different levels rather than clustered in the basal end.

Pseudostratified columnar epithelium is found in the respiratory tract, where some of these cells\nhave cilia.\nBoth simple and pseudostratified columnar epithelia are heterogeneous epithelia because they include additional\ntypes of cells interspersed among the epithelial cells.

You might think of a Roman centurion or a medieval knight in a suit of\narmor. The skin, in its own way, functions as a form of armor—body armor. It provides a barrier between your\nvital, life-sustaining organs and the influence of outside elements that could potentially damage them.\nFor any form of armor, a breach in the protective barrier poses a danger. The skin can be breached when a child\nskins a knee or an adult has blood drawn—one is accidental and the other medically necessary. However, you\nalso breach this barrier when you choose to “accessorize” your skin with a tattoo or body piercing. Because the\nneedles involved in producing body art and piercings must penetrate the skin, there are dangers associated with\nthe practice. These include allergic reactions; skin infections; blood-borne diseases, such as tetanus, hepatitis\nC, and hepatitis D; and the growth of scar tissue. Despite the risk, the practice of piercing the skin for decorative\npurposes has become increasingly popular. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 24 percent of\npeople from ages 18 to 50 have a tattoo.\n5.3 • Functions of the Integumentary System\n177\nvibration. Merkel cells, seen scattered in the stratum basale, are also touch receptors. In addition to these\nspecialized receptors, there are sensory nerves connected to each hair follicle, pain and temperature receptors\nscattered throughout the skin, and motor nerves innervate the arrector pili muscles and glands. This rich innervation\nhelps us sense our environment and react accordingly.\nFIGURE 5.15\nLight Micrograph of a Meissner Corpuscle\nIn this micrograph of a skin cross-section, you can see a Meissner corpuscle\n(arrow), a type of touch receptor located in a dermal papilla adjacent to the basement membrane and stratum basale of the overlying\nepidermis.', 'They occur most commonly\nover the hips and abdomen.\nCalluses\nWhen you wear shoes that do not fit well and are a constant source of abrasion on your toes, you tend to form a\ncallus at the point of contact. This occurs because the basal stem cells in the stratum basale are triggered to divide\nmore often to increase the thickness of the skin at the point of abrasion to protect the rest of the body from further\ndamage. This is an example of a minor or local injury, and the skin manages to react and treat the problem\nindependent of the rest of the body.

One of the functions of the integumentary system\nis protection.', 'Cell to Cell Junctions\nCells of epithelia are closely connected and are not separated by intracellular material. Three basic types of\nconnections allow varying degrees of interaction between the cells: tight junctions, anchoring junctions, and gap\njunctions (Figure 4.5).\n4.2 • Epithelial Tissue\n131\nFIGURE 4.5\nTypes of Cell Junctions\nThe three basic types of cell-to-cell junctions are tight junctions, gap junctions, and anchoring\njunctions.\nAt one end of the spectrum is the tight junction, which separates the cells into apical and basal compartments.\nWhen two adjacent epithelial cells form a tight junction, there is no extracellular space between them and the\nmovement of substances through the extracellular space between the cells is blocked. This enables the epithelia to\nact as selective barriers. An anchoring junction includes several types of cell junctions that help stabilize epithelial\ntissues. Anchoring junctions are common on the lateral and basal surfaces of cells where they provide strong and\nflexible connections. There are three types of anchoring junctions: desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, and adherens.\nDesmosomes occur in patches on the membranes of cells. The patches are structural proteins on the inner surface\nof the cell’s membrane. The adhesion molecule, cadherin, is embedded in these patches and projects through the\ncell membrane to link with the cadherin molecules of adjacent cells. These connections are especially important in\nholding cells together. Hemidesmosomes, which look like half a desmosome, link cells to the extracellular matrix,\nfor example, the basal lamina. While similar in appearance to desmosomes, they include the adhesion proteins\ncalled integrins rather than cadherins. Adherens junctions use either cadherins or integrins depending on whether\nthey are linking to other cells or matrix. The junctions are characterized by the presence of the contractile protein\nactin located on the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. The actin can connect isolated patches or form a\nbelt-like structure inside the cell. These junctions influence the shape and folding of the epithelial tissue.']",The arrector pili muscle is connected to each hair follicle.,Each hair root is connected to a smooth muscle called the arrector pili that contracts in response to nerve signals from the sympathetic nervous system.

You might think of a Roman centurion or a medieval knight in a suit of\narmor. The skin, in its own way, functions as a form of armor—body armor. It provides a barrier between your\nvital, life-sustaining organs and the influence of outside elements that could potentially damage them.\nFor any form of armor, a breach in the protective barrier poses a danger. The skin can be breached when a child\nskins a knee or an adult has blood drawn—one is accidental and the other medically necessary. However, you\nalso breach this barrier when you choose to “accessorize” your skin with a tattoo or body piercing. Because the\nneedles involved in producing body art and piercings must penetrate the skin, there are dangers associated with\nthe practice. These include allergic reactions; skin infections; blood-borne diseases, such as tetanus, hepatitis\nC, and hepatitis D; and the growth of scar tissue. Despite the risk, the practice of piercing the skin for decorative\npurposes has become increasingly popular. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 24 percent of\npeople from ages 18 to 50 have a tattoo.\n5.3 • Functions of the Integumentary System\n177\nvibration. Merkel cells, seen scattered in the stratum basale, are also touch receptors. In addition to these\nspecialized receptors, there are sensory nerves connected to each hair follicle, pain and temperature receptors\nscattered throughout the skin, and motor nerves innervate the arrector pili muscles and glands. This rich innervation\nhelps us sense our environment and react accordingly.\nFIGURE 5.15\nLight Micrograph of a Meissner Corpuscle\nIn this micrograph of a skin cross-section, you can see a Meissner corpuscle\n(arrow), a type of touch receptor located in a dermal papilla adjacent to the basement membrane and stratum basale of the overlying\nepidermis.', 'This rich innervation\nhelps us sense our environment and react accordingly.\nFIGURE 5.15\nLight Micrograph of a Meissner Corpuscle\nIn this micrograph of a skin cross-section, you can see a Meissner corpuscle\n(arrow), a type of touch receptor located in a dermal papilla adjacent to the basement membrane and stratum basale of the overlying\nepidermis.

The sympathetic\nnervous system is continuously monitoring body temperature and initiating appropriate motor responses. Recall\nthat sweat glands, accessory structures to the skin, secrete water, salt, and other substances to cool the body when\nit becomes warm. Even when the body does not appear to be noticeably sweating, approximately 500 mL of sweat\n(insensible perspiration) are secreted a day. If the body becomes excessively warm due to high temperatures,\nvigorous activity (Figure 5.16ac), or a combination of the two, sweat glands will be stimulated by the sympathetic\nnervous system to produce large amounts of sweat, as much as 0.7 to 1.5 L per hour for an active person. When the\nsweat evaporates from the skin surface, the body is cooled as body heat is dissipated.\nIn addition to sweating, arterioles in the dermis dilate so that excess heat carried by the blood can dissipate through\nthe skin and into the surrounding environment (Figure 5.16b).

The dermal papillae extending into the epidermis belong to the papillary layer, whereas the dense collagen fiber\nbundles below belong to the reticular layer. LM × 10. (credit: modification of work by “kilbad”/Wikimedia Commons)\nPapillary Layer\nThe papillary layer is made of loose, areolar connective tissue, which means the collagen and elastin fibers of this\nlayer form a loose mesh. This superficial layer of the dermis projects into the stratum basale of the epidermis to\nform finger-like dermal papillae (see Figure 5.7). Within the papillary layer are fibroblasts, a small number of fat\ncells (adipocytes), and an abundance of small blood vessels. In addition, the papillary layer contains phagocytes,\ndefensive cells that help fight bacteria or other infections that have breached the skin. This layer also contains\nlymphatic capillaries, nerve fibers, and touch receptors called the Meissner corpuscles.\nReticular Layer\nUnderlying the papillary layer is the much thicker reticular layer, composed of dense, irregular connective tissue.\nThis layer is well vascularized and has a rich sensory and sympathetic nerve supply. The reticular layer appears\nreticulated (net-like) due to a tight meshwork of fibers. Elastin fibers provide some elasticity to the skin, enabling\nmovement. Collagen fibers provide structure and tensile strength, with strands of collagen extending into both the\npapillary layer and the hypodermis. In addition, collagen binds water to keep the skin hydrated. Collagen injections\nand Retin-A creams help restore skin turgor by either introducing collagen externally or stimulating blood flow and\nrepair of the dermis, respectively.', 'Protection\nThe skin protects the rest of the body from the basic elements of nature such as wind, water, and UV sunlight. It acts\nas a protective barrier against water loss, due to the presence of layers of keratin and glycolipids in the stratum\ncorneum. It also is the first line of defense against abrasive activity due to contact with grit, microbes, or harmful\nchemicals. Sweat excreted from sweat glands deters microbes from over-colonizing the skin surface by generating\ndermicidin, which has antibiotic properties.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nTattooing has a long history, dating back thousands of years ago. The dyes used in tattooing typically derive from\nmetals. A person with tattoos should be cautious when having a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan because an\nMRI machine uses powerful magnets to create images of the soft tissues of the body, which could react with the\nmetals contained in the tattoo dyes. Watch this video (http://openstax.org/l/tattoo) to learn more about tattooing.\nSensory Function\nThe fact that you can feel an ant crawling on your skin, allowing you to flick it off before it bites, is because the skin,\nand especially the hairs projecting from hair follicles in the skin, can sense changes in the environment. The hair root\nplexus surrounding the base of the hair follicle senses a disturbance, and then transmits the information to the\ncentral nervous system (brain and spinal cord), which can then respond by activating the skeletal muscles of your\neyes to see the ant and the skeletal muscles of the body to act against the ant.\nThe skin acts as a sense organ because the epidermis, dermis, and the hypodermis contain specialized sensory\nnerve structures that detect touch, surface temperature, and pain.

Sweat excreted from sweat glands deters microbes from over-colonizing the skin surface by generating\ndermicidin, which has antibiotic properties.', 'There are two types of sweat glands, each\nsecreting slightly different products.\nAn eccrine sweat gland is type of gland that produces a hypotonic sweat for thermoregulation. These glands are\nfound all over the skin’s surface, but are especially abundant on the palms of the hand, the soles of the feet, and the\nforehead (Figure 5.14). They are coiled glands lying deep in the dermis, with the duct rising up to a pore on the skin\nsurface, where the sweat is released. This type of sweat, released by exocytosis, is hypotonic and composed mostly\nof water, with some salt, antibodies, traces of metabolic waste, and dermicidin, an antimicrobial peptide. Eccrine\nglands are a primary component of thermoregulation in humans and thus help to maintain homeostasis.\nFIGURE 5.14\nEccrine Gland\nEccrine glands are coiled glands in the dermis that release sweat that is mostly water.\nAn apocrine sweat gland is usually associated with hair follicles in densely hairy areas, such as armpits and genital\nregions. Apocrine sweat glands are larger than eccrine sweat glands and lie deeper in the dermis, sometimes even\nreaching the hypodermis, with the duct normally emptying into the hair follicle. In addition to water and salts,\napocrine sweat includes organic compounds that make the sweat thicker and subject to bacterial decomposition\nand subsequent smell. The release of this sweat is under both nervous and hormonal control, and plays a role in the\npoorly understood human pheromone response. Most commercial antiperspirants use an aluminum-based\ncompound as their primary active ingredient to stop sweat. When the antiperspirant enters the sweat gland duct,\nthe aluminum-based compounds precipitate due to a change in pH and form a physical block in the duct, which\nprevents sweat from coming out of the pore.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nSweating regulates body temperature.

Merocrine secretion is the most common type of\nexocrine secretion. The secretions are enclosed in vesicles that move to the apical surface of the cell where the\ncontents are released by exocytosis. For example, watery mucous containing the glycoprotein mucin, a lubricant\nthat offers some pathogen protection is a merocrine secretion. The eccrine glands that produce and secrete sweat\nare another example.\n138\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 4.10\nModes of Glandular Secretion\n(a) In merocrine secretion, the cell remains intact. (b) In apocrine secretion, the apical\nportion of the cell is released, as well. (c) In holocrine secretion, the cell is destroyed as it releases its product and the cell itself becomes\npart of the secretion.\nApocrine secretion accumulates near the apical portion of the cell. That portion of the cell and its secretory\ncontents pinch off from the cell and are released. Apocrine sweat glands in the axillary and genital areas release\nfatty secretions that local bacteria break down; this causes body odor. Both merocrine and apocrine glands continue\nto produce and secrete their contents with little damage caused to the cell because the nucleus and golgi regions\nremain intact after secretion.\nIn contrast, the process of holocrine secretion involves the rupture and destruction of the entire gland cell. The cell\naccumulates its secretory products and releases them only when it bursts. New gland cells differentiate from cells\nin the surrounding tissue to replace those lost by secretion.

Clotting\n(coagulation) reduces blood loss from damaged blood vessels and forms a network of fibrin proteins that trap blood\ncells and bind the edges of the wound together. A scab forms when the clot dries, reducing the risk of infection.\nSometimes a mixture of dead leukocytes and fluid called pus accumulates in the wound. As healing progresses,\nfibroblasts from the surrounding connective tissues replace the collagen and extracellular material lost by the injury.\nAngiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, results in vascularization of the new tissue known as granulation\ntissue. The clot retracts pulling the edges of the wound together, and it slowly dissolves as the tissue is repaired.\nWhen a large amount of granulation tissue forms and capillaries disappear, a pale scar is often visible in the healed\narea. A primary union describes the healing of a wound where the edges are close together. When there is a gaping\nwound, it takes longer to refill the area with cells and collagen. The process called secondary union occurs as the\nedges of the wound are pulled together by what is called wound contraction. When a wound is more than one\nquarter of an inch deep, sutures (stitches) are recommended to promote a primary union and avoid the formation of\na disfiguring scar. Regeneration is the addition of new cells of the same type as the ones that were injured (Figure\n4.21).', 'These can build up in the blood, causing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis.

As with\nacidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low.\nLung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the\nnormal concentration of H+.\nMetabolic alkalosis often results from prolonged, severe vomiting, which causes a loss of hydrogen and chloride ions\n(as components of HCl). Medications also can prompt alkalosis. These include diuretics that cause the body to lose\npotassium ions, as well as antacids when taken in excessive amounts, for instance by someone with persistent\nheartburn or an ulcer.\n2.5 Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nIdentify four types of organic molecules essential to human functioning\n•\nExplain the chemistry behind carbon’s affinity for covalently bonding in organic compounds\n•\nProvide examples of three types of carbohydrates, and identify the primary functions of carbohydrates in the\nbody\n•\nDiscuss four types of lipids important in human functioning\n•\nDescribe the structure of proteins, and discuss their importance to human functioning\n•\nIdentify the building blocks of nucleic acids, and the roles of DNA, RNA, and ATP in human functioning\nOrganic compounds typically consist of groups of carbon atoms covalently bonded to hydrogen, usually oxygen, and\noften other elements as well. They are found throughout the world, in soils and seas, commercial products, and\nevery cell of the human body. The four types most important to human structure and function are carbohydrates,\nlipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Before exploring these compounds, you need to first understand the chemistry of\ncarbon.\nThe Chemistry of Carbon\nWhat makes organic compounds ubiquitous is the chemistry of their carbon core. Recall that carbon atoms have four\nelectrons in their valence shell, and that the octet rule dictates that atoms tend to react in such a way as to\ncomplete their valence shell with eight electrons.', 'Telophase is followed by the division of the\ncytoplasm (cytokinesis), which generates two daughter\ncells. This process takes place in all normally dividing\ncells of the body except for the germ cells that produce\neggs and sperm.\n3.6 Cellular Differentiation\nOne of the major areas of research in biology is that of\nhow cells specialize to assume their unique structures\nand functions, since all cells essentially originate from\na single fertilized egg. Cell differentiation is the process\nof cells becoming specialized as they body develops. A\nstem cell is an unspecialized cell that can divide\nwithout limit as needed and can, under specific\nconditions, differentiate into specialized cells. Stem\ncells are divided into several categories according to\ntheir potential to differentiate. While all somatic cells\ncontain the exact same genome, different cell types\nonly express some of those genes at any given time.\nThese differences in gene expression ultimately dictate\na cell’s unique morphological and physiological\ncharacteristics. The primary mechanism that\ndetermines which genes will be expressed and which\nones will not is through the use of different\ntranscription factor proteins, which bind to DNA and\npromote or hinder the transcription of different genes.\nThrough the action of these transcription factors, cells\nspecialize into one of hundreds of different cell types in\nthe human body.\nInteractive Link Questions\n1.

Where do dermatologists typically work?,"['CAREER CONNECTION\nDermatologist\nHave you ever had a rash that did not respond to over-the-counter creams, or a mole that you were concerned\nabout? Dermatologists help patients with these types of problems and more, on a daily basis. Dermatologists are\nmedical doctors who specialize in diagnosing and treating skin disorders. Like all medical doctors, dermatologists\nearn a medical degree and then complete several years of residency training. In addition, dermatologists may then\nparticipate in a dermatology fellowship or complete additional, specialized training in a dermatology practice. If\npracticing in the United States, dermatologists must pass the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE),\nbecome licensed in their state of practice, and be certified by the American Board of Dermatology.\nMost dermatologists work in a medical office or private-practice setting. They diagnose skin conditions and rashes,\nprescribe oral and topical medications to treat skin conditions, and may perform simple procedures, such as mole or\nwart removal. In addition, they may refer patients to an oncologist if skin cancer that has metastasized is suspected.\nRecently, cosmetic procedures have also become a prominent part of dermatology. Botox injections, laser\ntreatments, and collagen and dermal filler injections are popular among patients, hoping to reduce the appearance\nof skin aging.\nDermatology is a competitive specialty in medicine. Limited openings in dermatology residency programs mean that\nmany medical students compete for a few select spots. Dermatology is an appealing specialty to many prospective\ndoctors, because unlike emergency room physicians or surgeons, dermatologists generally do not have to work\nexcessive hours or be “on-call” weekends and holidays. Moreover, the popularity of cosmetic dermatology has made\nit a growing field with many lucrative opportunities. It is not unusual for dermatology clinics to market themselves\nexclusively as cosmetic dermatology centers, and for dermatologists to specialize exclusively in these procedures.\nConsider visiting a dermatologist to talk about why they entered the field and what the field of dermatology is like.\nVisit this site (http://www.Diplomaguide.com) for additional information.\nInjuries\nBecause the skin is the part of our bodies that meets the world most directly, it is especially vulnerable to injury.\nInjuries include burns and wounds, as well as scars and calluses.', 'It may\nbe accompanied by swelling of the skin, flaking, and in severe cases, bleeding. Many who suffer from eczema have\nantibodies against dust mites in their blood, but the link between eczema and allergy to dust mites has not been\nproven. Symptoms are usually managed with moisturizers, corticosteroid creams, and immunosuppressants.\nFIGURE 5.21\nEczema\nEczema is a common skin disorder that presents as a red, flaky rash. (credit: “Jambula” Wikimedia Commons /\nNIAID, Flickr)\nAcne\nAcne is a skin disturbance that typically occurs on areas of the skin that are rich in sebaceous glands (face and\nback). It is most common along with the onset of puberty due to associated hormonal changes, but can also occur in\ninfants and continue into adulthood. Hormones, such as androgens, stimulate the release of sebum. An\noverproduction and accumulation of sebum along with keratin can block hair follicles. This plug is initially white. The\nsebum, when oxidized by exposure to air, turns black. Acne results from infection by acne-causing bacteria\n(Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus), which can lead to redness and potential scarring due to the natural wound\nhealing process (Figure 5.22).\n182\n5 • The Integumentary System\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 5.22\nAcne\nAcne is a result of over-productive sebaceous glands, which leads to formation of blackheads and inflammation of\nthe skin.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nDermatologist\nHave you ever had a rash that did not respond to over-the-counter creams, or a mole that you were concerned\nabout?

Molecules (or ions) will spread/diffuse from where they are more concentrated to where they are\nless concentrated until they are equally distributed in that space. (When molecules move in this way, they are said to\nmove down their concentration gradient.) Diffusion is the movement of particles from an area of higher\nconcentration to an area of lower concentration. A couple of common examples will help to illustrate this concept.\nImagine being inside a closed bathroom. If a bottle of perfume were sprayed, the scent molecules would naturally\ndiffuse from the spot where they left the bottle to all corners of the bathroom, and this diffusion would go on until no\nmore concentration gradient remains. Another example is a spoonful of sugar placed in a cup of tea. Eventually the\nsugar will diffuse throughout the tea until no concentration gradient remains. In both cases, if the room is warmer or\nthe tea hotter, diffusion occurs even faster as the molecules are bumping into each other and spreading out faster\nthan at cooler temperatures. Having an internal body temperature around 98.6° F thus also aids in diffusion of\nparticles within the body.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nVisit this link (http://openstax.org/l/diffusion) to see diffusion and how it is propelled by the kinetic energy of\nmolecules in solution. How does temperature affect diffusion rate, and why?\nWhenever a substance exists in greater concentration on one side of a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell\nmembranes, any substance that can move down its concentration gradient across the membrane will do so.\nConsider substances that can easily diffuse through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane, such as the gases oxygen\n(O2) and CO2. O2 generally diffuses into cells because it is more concentrated outside of them, and CO2 typically\ndiffuses out of cells because it is more concentrated inside of them. Neither of these examples requires any energy\non the part of the cell, and therefore they use passive transport to move across the membrane.\nBefore moving on, you need to review the gases that can diffuse across a cell membrane. Because cells rapidly use\nup oxygen during metabolism, there is typically a lower concentration of O2 inside the cell than outside.', 'O2 generally diffuses into cells because it is more concentrated outside of them, and CO2 typically\ndiffuses out of cells because it is more concentrated inside of them. Neither of these examples requires any energy\non the part of the cell, and therefore they use passive transport to move across the membrane.\nBefore moving on, you need to review the gases that can diffuse across a cell membrane. Because cells rapidly use\nup oxygen during metabolism, there is typically a lower concentration of O2 inside the cell than outside. As a result,\noxygen will diffuse from the interstitial fluid directly through the lipid bilayer of the membrane and into the\ncytoplasm within the cell. On the other hand, because cells produce CO2 as a byproduct of metabolism, CO2\nconcentrations rise within the cytoplasm; therefore, CO2 will move from the cell through the lipid bilayer and into the\ninterstitial fluid, where its concentration is lower. This mechanism of molecules moving across a cell membrane\nfrom the side where they are more concentrated to the side where they are less concentrated is a form of passive\ntransport called simple diffusion (Figure 3.5).\nFIGURE 3.5\nSimple Diffusion across the Cell (Plasma) Membrane\nThe structure of the lipid bilayer allows small, uncharged\nsubstances such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, and hydrophobic molecules such as lipids, to pass through the cell membrane, down their\nconcentration gradient, by simple diffusion.\nLarge polar or ionic molecules, which are hydrophilic, cannot easily cross the phospholipid bilayer. Very small polar\nmolecules, such as water, can cross via simple diffusion due to their small size. Charged atoms or molecules of any\nsize cannot cross the cell membrane via simple diffusion as the charges are repelled by the hydrophobic tails in the\ninterior of the phospholipid bilayer. Solutes dissolved in water on either side of the cell membrane will tend to\n3.1 • The Cell Membrane\n85\ndiffuse down their concentration gradients, but because most substances cannot pass freely through the lipid\nbilayer of the cell membrane, their movement is restricted to protein channels and specialized transport\nmechanisms in the membrane.', ""The electrical activity that derives from the\ninteractions of the charged ions is why they are also called electrolytes.\nCovalent Bonds\nUnlike ionic bonds formed by the attraction between a cation’s positive charge and an anion’s negative charge,\nmolecules formed by a covalent bond share electrons in a mutually stabilizing relationship. Like next-door\nneighbors whose kids hang out first at one home and then at the other, the atoms do not lose or gain electrons\npermanently. Instead, the electrons move back and forth between the elements. Because of the close sharing of\npairs of electrons (one electron from each of two atoms), covalent bonds are stronger than ionic bonds.\nNonpolar Covalent Bonds\nFigure 2.9 shows several common types of covalent bonds. Notice that the two covalently bonded atoms typically\nshare just one or two electron pairs, though larger sharings are possible. The important concept to take from this is\nthat in covalent bonds, electrons in the two atoms' overlapping atomic orbitals are shared to fill the valence shells of\nboth atoms, ultimately stabilizing both of the atoms involved. In a single covalent bond, a single electron pair is\nshared between two atoms, while in a double covalent bond, two pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms.\nThere even are triple covalent bonds, where three electron pairs are shared between two atoms.\nFIGURE 2.9\nCovalent Bonding\nYou can see that the covalent bonds shown in Figure 2.9 are balanced. The sharing of the negative electrons is\nrelatively equal, as is the electrical pull of the positive protons in the nucleus of the atoms involved. This is why\ncovalently bonded molecules that are electrically balanced in this way are described as nonpolar; that is, no region\nof the molecule is either more positive or more negative than any other.\nPolar Covalent Bonds\nGroups of legislators with completely opposite views on a particular issue are often described as “polarized” by\nnews writers. In chemistry, a polar molecule is a molecule that contains regions that have opposite electrical\ncharges. Polar molecules occur when atoms share electrons unequally, in polar covalent bonds.\n2.2 • Chemical Bonds\n49\nThe most familiar example of a polar molecule is water (Figure 2.10).""]",Dermatologists typically work in medical offices or private-practice settings.,Most dermatologists work in a medical office or private-practice setting.

A basal cell is a cuboidal-shaped stem cell\n5.1 • Layers of the Skin\n165\nthat is a precursor of the keratinocytes of the epidermis. All of the keratinocytes are produced from this single layer\nof cells, which are constantly going through mitosis to produce new cells. As new cells are formed, the existing cells\nare pushed superficially away from the stratum basale. Two other cell types are found dispersed among the basal\ncells in the stratum basale. The first is a Merkel cell, which functions as a receptor and is responsible for stimulating\nsensory nerves that the brain perceives as touch. These cells are especially abundant on the surfaces of the hands\nand feet. The second is a melanocyte, a cell that produces the pigment melanin. Melanin gives hair and skin its\ncolor, and also helps protect the living cells of the epidermis from ultraviolet (UV) radiation damage.\nIn a growing fetus, fingerprints form where the cells of the stratum basale meet the papillae of the underlying\ndermal layer (papillary layer), resulting in the formation of the ridges on your fingers that you recognize as\nfingerprints. Fingerprints are unique to each individual and are used for forensic analyses because the patterns do\nnot change with the growth and aging processes.\nStratum Spinosum\nAs the name suggests, the stratum spinosum is spiny in appearance due to the protruding cell processes that join\nthe cells via a structure called a desmosome.', 'Note the significant difference in the thickness of the epithelial layer of the thick skin.

The sympathetic\nnervous system is continuously monitoring body temperature and initiating appropriate motor responses. Recall\nthat sweat glands, accessory structures to the skin, secrete water, salt, and other substances to cool the body when\nit becomes warm. Even when the body does not appear to be noticeably sweating, approximately 500 mL of sweat\n(insensible perspiration) are secreted a day. If the body becomes excessively warm due to high temperatures,\nvigorous activity (Figure 5.16ac), or a combination of the two, sweat glands will be stimulated by the sympathetic\nnervous system to produce large amounts of sweat, as much as 0.7 to 1.5 L per hour for an active person. When the\nsweat evaporates from the skin surface, the body is cooled as body heat is dissipated.\nIn addition to sweating, arterioles in the dermis dilate so that excess heat carried by the blood can dissipate through\nthe skin and into the surrounding environment (Figure 5.16b). This accounts for the skin redness that many people\nexperience when exercising.\n178\n5 • The Integumentary System\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 5.16\nThermoregulation\nDuring strenuous physical activities, such as skiing (a) or running (c), the dermal blood vessels dilate\nand sweat secretion increases (b).

The medulla forms the central core of the hair, which is surrounded by the cortex, a layer of\ncompressed, keratinized cells that is covered by an outer layer of very hard, keratinized cells known as the cuticle.\nThese layers are depicted in a longitudinal cross-section of the hair follicle (Figure 5.12), although not all hair has a\nmedullary layer. Hair texture (straight, curly) is determined by the shape and structure of the cortex, and to the\nextent that it is present, the medulla. The shape and structure of these layers are, in turn, determined by the shape\nof the hair follicle. Hair growth begins with the production of keratinocytes by the basal cells of the hair bulb. As new\ncells are deposited at the hair bulb, the hair shaft is pushed through the follicle toward the surface. Keratinization is\ncompleted as the cells are pushed to the skin surface to form the shaft of hair that is externally visible. The external\nhair is completely dead and composed entirely of keratin. For this reason, our hair does not have sensation.\nFurthermore, you can cut your hair or shave without damaging the hair structure because the cut is superficial. Most\nchemical hair removers also act superficially; however, electrolysis and yanking both attempt to destroy the hair\nbulb so hair cannot grow.\n5.2 • Accessory Structures of the Skin\n173\nFIGURE 5.12\nHair Follicle\nThe slide shows a cross-section of a hair follicle. Basal cells of the hair matrix in the center differentiate into\ncells of the inner root sheath.', 'Hair serves a variety of functions, including protection, sensory input, thermoregulation, and communication. For\nexample, hair on the head protects the skull from the sun. The hair in the nose and ears, and around the eyes\n(eyelashes) defends the body by trapping and excluding dust particles that may contain allergens and microbes.\nHair of the eyebrows prevents sweat and other particles from dripping into and bothering the eyes. Hair also has a\nsensory function due to sensory innervation by a hair root plexus surrounding the base of each hair follicle. Hair is\nextremely sensitive to air movement or other disturbances in the environment, much more so than the skin surface.\nThis feature is also useful for the detection of the presence of insects or other potentially damaging substances on\nthe skin surface. Each hair root is connected to a smooth muscle called the arrector pili that contracts in response\nto nerve signals from the sympathetic nervous system, making the external hair shaft “stand up.” The primary\npurpose for this is to trap a layer of air to add insulation. This is visible in humans as goose bumps and even more\nobvious in animals, such as when a frightened cat raises its fur. Of course, this is much more obvious in organisms\nwith a heavier coat than most humans, such as dogs and cats.\nHair Growth\nHair grows and is eventually shed and replaced by new hair. This occurs in three phases. The first is the anagen\nphase, during which cells divide rapidly at the root of the hair, pushing the hair shaft up and out. The length of this\nphase is measured in years, typically from 2 to 7 years. The catagen phase lasts only 2 to 3 weeks, and marks a\ntransition from the hair follicle’s active growth. Finally, during the telogen phase, the hair follicle is at rest and no\nnew growth occurs. At the end of this phase, which lasts about 2 to 4 months, another anagen phase begins. The\nbasal cells in the hair matrix then produce a new hair follicle, which pushes the old hair out as the growth cycle\nrepeats itself. Hair typically grows at the rate of 0.3 mm per day during the anagen phase. On average, 50 hairs are\nlost and replaced per day.', 'The rest of the hair, which is anchored\nin the follicle, lies below the surface of the skin and is referred to as the hair root. The hair root ends deep in the\ndermis at the hair bulb, and includes a layer of mitotically active basal cells called the hair matrix. The hair bulb\nsurrounds the hair papilla, which is made of connective tissue and contains blood capillaries and nerve endings\nfrom the dermis (Figure 5.11).\nFIGURE 5.10\nVitiligo\nIndividuals with vitiligo experience depigmentation that results in lighter colored patches of skin. The\ncondition is especially noticeable on darker skin. (credit: (a) Klaus D. Peter (b) Owl Bridge Media / Wikimedia.)\nOther changes in the appearance of skin coloration can be indicative of diseases associated with other body\nsystems. Liver disease or liver cancer can cause the accumulation of bile and the yellow pigment bilirubin,\nleading to the skin appearing yellow or jaundiced (jaune is the French word for “yellow”). Tumors of the pituitary\ngland can result in the secretion of large amounts of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), which results in a\ndarkening of the skin. Similarly, Addison’s disease can stimulate the release of excess amounts of\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which can give the skin a deep bronze color. A sudden drop in oxygenation\ncan affect skin color, causing the skin to initially turn ashen (white). With a prolonged reduction in oxygen levels,\ndark red deoxyhemoglobin becomes dominant in the blood, making the skin appear blue, a condition referred to\nas cyanosis (kyanos is the Greek word for “blue”). This happens when the oxygen supply is restricted, as when\nsomeone is experiencing difficulty in breathing because of asthma or a heart attack. However, in these cases the\neffect on skin color has nothing do with the skin’s pigmentation.\n172\n5 • The Integumentary System\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 5.11\nHair\nHair follicles originate in the epidermis and have many different parts.', 'They also tend to be more sensitive to light and\nhave vision problems due to the lack of pigmentation on the retinal wall.

In this section, you will learn several of the most common skin conditions.\nDiseases\nOne of the most talked about diseases is skin cancer. Cancer is a broad term that describes diseases caused by\nabnormal cells in the body dividing uncontrollably. Most cancers are identified by the organ or tissue in which the\ncancer originates. One common form of cancer is skin cancer. The Skin Cancer Foundation reports that one in five\nAmericans will experience some type of skin cancer in their lifetime. The degradation of the ozone layer in the\natmosphere and the resulting increase in exposure to UV radiation has contributed to its rise. Overexposure to UV\nradiation damages DNA, which can lead to the formation of cancerous lesions. Although melanin offers some\nprotection against DNA damage from the sun, often it is not enough. The fact that cancers can also occur on areas of\nthe body that are normally not exposed to UV radiation suggests that there are additional factors that can lead to\ncancerous lesions.\nIn general, cancers result from an accumulation of DNA mutations. These mutations can result in cell populations\nthat do not die when they should and uncontrolled cell proliferation that leads to tumors. Although many tumors are\nbenign (harmless), some produce cells that can mobilize and establish tumors in other organs of the body; this\nprocess is referred to as metastasis. Cancers are characterized by their ability to metastasize.\nBasal Cell Carcinoma\nBasal cell carcinoma is a form of cancer that affects the mitotically active stem cells in the stratum basale of the\nThe accessory structures also have lowered activity, generating thinner hair and nails, and reduced amounts of\nsebum and sweat. A reduced sweating ability can cause some elderly to be intolerant to extreme heat. Other\ncells in the skin, such as melanocytes and dendritic cells, also become less active, leading to a paler skin tone\nand lowered immunity. Wrinkling of the skin occurs due to breakdown of its structure, which results from\ndecreased collagen and elastin production in the dermis, weakening of muscles lying under the skin, and the\ninability of the skin to retain adequate moisture.', 'The hypodermis, with its fat\nstores, loses structure due to the reduction and redistribution of fat, which in turn contributes to the thinning\nand sagging of skin.\nFIGURE 5.17\nAging\nGenerally, skin, especially on the face and hands, starts to display the first noticeable signs of aging, as it loses\nits elasticity over time. (credit: Janet Ramsden)\n5.3 • Functions of the Integumentary System\n179\nVitamin D Synthesis\nThe epidermal layer of human skin synthesizes vitamin D when exposed to UV radiation. In the presence of\nsunlight, a form of vitamin D3 called cholecalciferol is synthesized from a derivative of the steroid cholesterol in the\nskin. The liver converts cholecalciferol to calcidiol, which is then converted to calcitriol (the active chemical form of\nthe vitamin) in the kidneys. Vitamin D is essential for normal absorption of calcium and phosphorous, which are\nrequired for healthy bones. The absence of sun exposure can lead to a lack of vitamin D in the body, leading to a\ncondition called rickets, a painful condition in children where the bones are misshapen due to a lack of calcium,\ncausing bowleggedness. Elderly individuals who suffer from vitamin D deficiency can develop a condition called\nosteomalacia, a softening of the bones. In present day society, vitamin D is added as a supplement to many foods,\nincluding milk and orange juice, compensating for the need for sun exposure.\nIn addition to its essential role in bone health, vitamin D is essential for general immunity against bacterial, viral,\nand fungal infections. Recent studies are also finding a link between insufficient vitamin D and cancer.\n5.4 Diseases, Disorders, and Injuries of the Integumentary System\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe several different diseases and disorders of the skin\n•\nDescribe the effect of injury to the skin and the process of healing\nThe integumentary system is susceptible to a variety of diseases, disorders, and injuries.

In this section, you will learn several of the most common skin conditions.', 'Too much sun exposure can eventually lead to wrinkling due to the destruction of the cellular structure of the skin,\nand in severe cases, can cause sufficient DNA damage to result in skin cancer. When there is an irregular\naccumulation of melanocytes in the skin, freckles appear. Moles are larger masses of melanocytes, and although\nmost are benign, they should be monitored for changes that might indicate the presence of cancer (Figure 5.9).\n170\n5 • The Integumentary System\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 5.9\nMoles\nMoles range from benign accumulations of melanocytes to melanomas.

(credit: the National Cancer Institute)\nDisorders of the...\nIntegumentary System\nThe first thing a clinician sees is the skin, and so the examination of the skin should be part of any thorough\nphysical examination. Most skin disorders are relatively benign, but a few, including melanomas, can be fatal if\nuntreated. A couple of the more noticeable disorders, albinism and vitiligo, affect the appearance of the skin and\nits accessory organs. Although neither is fatal, it would be hard to claim that they are benign, at least to the\nindividuals so afflicted.\nAlbinism is a genetic disorder that affects (completely or partially) the coloring of skin, hair, and eyes. The\ndefect is primarily due to the inability of melanocytes to produce melanin. Individuals with albinism tend to\nappear white or very pale due to the lack of melanin in their skin and hair. Recall that melanin helps protect the\nskin from the harmful effects of UV radiation. Individuals with albinism tend to need more protection from UV\nradiation, as they are more prone to sunburns and skin cancer. They also tend to be more sensitive to light and\nhave vision problems due to the lack of pigmentation on the retinal wall. Treatment of this disorder usually\ninvolves addressing the symptoms, such as limiting UV light exposure to the skin and eyes. In vitiligo, the\nmelanocytes in certain areas lose their ability to produce melanin, possibly due to an autoimmune reaction. This\nleads to a loss of color in patches (Figure 5.10).', 'The topmost\nlayer, the stratum corneum, consists of dead cells that\nshed periodically and is progressively replaced by cells\nformed from the basal layer. The stratum basale also\ncontains melanocytes, cells that produce melanin, the\npigment primarily responsible for giving skin its color.\nMelanin is transferred to keratinocytes in the stratum\nspinosum to protect cells from UV rays.\nThe dermis connects the epidermis to the hypodermis,\nand provides strength and elasticity due to the\npresence of collagen and elastin fibers. It has only two\nlayers: the papillary layer with papillae that extend into\nthe epidermis and the lower, reticular layer composed\nof loose connective tissue. The hypodermis, deep to\nthe dermis of skin, is the connective tissue that\nconnects the dermis to underlying structures; it also\nharbors adipose tissue for fat storage and protection.\n5.2 Accessory Structures of the Skin\nAccessory structures of the skin include hair, nails,\nsweat glands, and sebaceous glands. Hair is made of\n5 • Chapter Review\n187\ndead keratinized cells, and gets its color from melanin\npigments. Nails, also made of dead keratinized cells,\nprotect the extremities of our fingers and toes from\nmechanical damage. Sweat glands and sebaceous\nglands produce sweat and sebum, respectively. Each of\nthese fluids has a role to play in maintaining\nhomeostasis. Sweat cools the body surface when it\ngets overheated and helps excrete small amounts of\nmetabolic waste. Sebum acts as a natural moisturizer\nand keeps the dead, flaky, outer keratin layer healthy.\n5.3 Functions of the Integumentary System\nThe skin plays important roles in protection, sensing\nstimuli, thermoregulation, and vitamin D synthesis. It is\nthe first layer of defense to prevent dehydration,\ninfection, and injury to the rest of the body. Sweat\nglands in the skin allow the skin surface to cool when\nthe body gets overheated. Thermoregulation is also\naccomplished by the dilation or constriction of heat-\ncarrying blood vessels in the skin.']","The process that darkens skin when exposed to UV light is the increased production of melanin by melanocytes in the skin, which helps protect against DNA damage from UV radiation.",The process that darkens skin when it is exposed to UV light is melanization.
