What is homeostasis?,"['Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a). A sensor, also referred to a receptor, is a\ncomponent of a feedback system that monitors a physiological value. This value is reported to the control center.\nThe control center is the component in a feedback system that compares the value to the normal range. If the value\ndeviates too much from the set point, then the control center activates an effector. An effector is the component in\na feedback system that causes a change to reverse the situation and return the value to the normal range.\n20\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 1.10\nNegative Feedback System\nIn a negative feedback system, a stimulus—a deviation from a set point—is resisted through\na physiological process that returns the body to homeostasis. (a) A negative feedback system has five basic parts. (b) Body temperature is\nregulated by negative feedback.\nIn order to set the system in motion, a stimulus must drive a physiological parameter beyond its normal range (that\nis, beyond homeostasis). This stimulus is “heard” by a specific sensor. For example, in the control of blood glucose,\nspecific endocrine cells in the pancreas detect excess glucose (the stimulus) in the bloodstream. These pancreatic\nbeta cells respond to the increased level of blood glucose by releasing the hormone insulin into the bloodstream.\nThe insulin signals skeletal muscle fibers, fat cells (adipocytes), and liver cells to take up the excess glucose,\nremoving it from the bloodstream. As glucose concentration in the bloodstream drops, the decrease in\nconcentration—the actual negative feedback—is detected by pancreatic alpha cells, and insulin release stops. This\nprevents blood sugar levels from continuing to drop below the normal range.\nHumans have a similar temperature regulation feedback system that works by promoting either heat loss or heat\ngain (Figure 1.10b).', 'The insulin signals skeletal muscle fibers, fat cells (adipocytes), and liver cells to take up the excess glucose,\nremoving it from the bloodstream. As glucose concentration in the bloodstream drops, the decrease in\nconcentration—the actual negative feedback—is detected by pancreatic alpha cells, and insulin release stops. This\nprevents blood sugar levels from continuing to drop below the normal range.\nHumans have a similar temperature regulation feedback system that works by promoting either heat loss or heat\ngain (Figure 1.10b). When the brain’s temperature regulation center receives data from the sensors indicating that\nthe body’s temperature exceeds its normal range, it stimulates a cluster of brain cells referred to as the “heat-loss\ncenter.” This stimulation has three major effects:\n•\nBlood vessels in the skin begin to dilate allowing more blood from the body core to flow to the surface of the\nskin allowing the heat to radiate into the environment.\n•\nAs blood flow to the skin increases, sweat glands are activated to increase their output. As the sweat\nevaporates from the skin surface into the surrounding air, it takes heat with it.\n•\nThe depth of respiration increases, and a person may breathe through an open mouth instead of through the\nnasal passageways. This further increases heat loss from the lungs.\nIn contrast, activation of the brain’s heat-gain center by exposure to cold reduces blood flow to the skin, and blood\nreturning from the limbs is diverted into a network of deep veins. This arrangement traps heat closer to the body\ncore and restricts heat loss. If heat loss is severe, the brain triggers an increase in random signals to skeletal\nmuscles, causing them to contract and producing shivering. The muscle contractions of shivering release heat while\nusing up ATP. The brain triggers the thyroid gland in the endocrine system to release thyroid hormone, which\nincreases metabolic activity and heat production in cells throughout the body. The brain also signals the adrenal\nglands to release epinephrine (adrenaline), a hormone that causes the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which\ncan be used as an energy source. The breakdown of glycogen into glucose also results in increased metabolism and\nheat production.\n1.5 • Homeostasis\n21\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nWater concentration in the body is critical for proper functioning.', 'This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids. For example, if there is\neven a slight decrease below 7.35 in the pH of a bodily fluid, the buffer in the fluid—in this case, acting as a weak\nbase—will bind the excess hydrogen ions. In contrast, if pH rises above 7.45, the buffer will act as a weak acid and\ncontribute hydrogen ions.\n60\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nHOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCES\nAcids and Bases\nExcessive acidity of the blood and other body fluids is known as acidosis. Common causes of acidosis are situations\nand disorders that reduce the effectiveness of breathing, especially the person’s ability to exhale fully, which causes\na buildup of CO2 (and H+) in the bloodstream. Acidosis can also be caused by metabolic problems that reduce the\nlevel or function of buffers that act as bases, or that promote the production of acids. For instance, with severe\ndiarrhea, too much bicarbonate can be lost from the body, allowing acids to build up in body fluids. In people with\npoorly managed diabetes (ineffective regulation of blood sugar), acids called ketones are produced as a form of\nbody fuel. These can build up in the blood, causing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Kidney failure,\nliver failure, heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.\nIn contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic). As with\nacidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low.\nLung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the\nnormal concentration of H+.', 'Immediate treatment is with\npure oxygen. The affected person is then moved into a hyperbaric chamber. A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,\nclosed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body\nso that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to\nthe body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing\nsome of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.\nThe dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the\npressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body\ntissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the\npulsating flow of pressurized blood.\n1.5 Homeostasis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning\n•\nContrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism\nMaintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body\ntemperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point.\nA set point is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set\nof values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is\napproximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to\nfluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a).', 'The brain triggers the thyroid gland in the endocrine system to release thyroid hormone, which\nincreases metabolic activity and heat production in cells throughout the body.

The breakdown of glycogen into glucose also results in increased metabolism and\nheat production.\n1.5 • Homeostasis\n21\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nWater concentration in the body is critical for proper functioning. A person’s body retains very tight control on water\nlevels without conscious control by the person. Watch this video (http://openstax.org/l/H2Ocon) to learn more about\nwater concentration in the body. Which organ has primary control over the amount of water in the body?\nPositive Feedback\nPositive feedback intensifies a change in the body’s physiological condition rather than reversing it. A deviation\nfrom the normal range results in more change, and the system moves farther away from the normal range. Positive\nfeedback in the body is normal only when there is a definite end point. Childbirth and the body’s response to blood\nloss are two examples of positive feedback loops that are normal but are activated only when needed.\nChildbirth at full term is an example of a situation in which the maintenance of the existing body state is not desired.\nEnormous changes in a person’s body are required to expel the baby at the end of pregnancy. And the events of\nchildbirth, once begun, must progress rapidly to a conclusion or the life of a person giving bith and the baby are at\nrisk. The extreme muscular work of labor and delivery are the result of a positive feedback system (Figure 1.11).\nFIGURE 1.11\nPositive Feedback Loop\nNormal childbirth is driven by a positive feedback loop. A positive feedback loop results in a\nchange in the body’s status, rather than a return to homeostasis.\nThe first contractions of labor (the stimulus) push the baby toward the cervix (the lowest part of the uterus). The\ncervix contains stretch-sensitive nerve cells that monitor the degree of stretching (the sensors). These nerve cells\nsend messages to the brain, which in turn causes the pituitary gland at the base of the brain to release the hormone\noxytocin into the bloodstream.']","Homeostasis is the body's ability to maintain stable internal conditions, such as temperature and pH, within a normal range despite external changes. It involves continuous monitoring and regulation of physiological parameters through mechanisms like negative feedback, which reverses deviations from set points to restore balance.","Homeostasis is the ability of the body to maintain a stable internal environment despite changes in external conditions, ensuring that the body's functions remain within a narrow range of normal values."
Where is the nucleus located within a cell?,"['The\nendoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and\nlysosomes share a functional connectivity and are\ncollectively referred to as the endomembrane system.\nThere are two types of ER: smooth and rough. While\nthe smooth ER performs many functions, including lipid\nsynthesis and ion storage, the rough ER is mainly\nresponsible for protein synthesis using its associated\nribosomes. The rough ER sends newly made proteins\nto the Golgi apparatus where they are modified and\npackaged for delivery to various locations within or\noutside of the cell. Some of these protein products are\nenzymes destined to break down unwanted material\nand are packaged as lysosomes for use inside the cell.\nCells also contain mitochondria and peroxisomes,\nwhich are the organelles responsible for producing the\ncell’s energy supply and detoxifying certain chemicals,\nrespectively. Biochemical reactions within\nmitochondria transform energy-carrying molecules into\nthe usable form of cellular energy known as ATP.\nPeroxisomes contain enzymes that transform harmful\nsubstances such as free radicals into oxygen and water.\nCells also contain a miniaturized “skeleton” of protein\nfilaments that extend throughout its interior. Three\ndifferent kinds of filaments compose this cytoskeleton\n(in order of increasing thickness): microfilaments,\nintermediate filaments, and microtubules. Each\ncytoskeletal component performs unique functions as\nwell as provides a supportive framework for the cell.\n3.3 The Nucleus and DNA Replication\nThe nucleus is the command center of the cell,\ncontaining the genetic instructions for all of the\nmaterials a cell will make (and thus all of its functions it\ncan perform). The nucleus is encased within a\nmembrane of two interconnected lipid bilayers, side-\nby-side. This nuclear envelope is studded with protein-\nlined pores that allow materials to be trafficked into\nand out of the nucleus. The nucleus contains one or\nmore nucleoli, which serve as sites for ribosome\nsynthesis. The nucleus houses the genetic material of\nthe cell: DNA. DNA is normally found as a loosely\ncontained structure called chromatin within the\nnucleus, where it is wound up and associated with a\nvariety of histone proteins. When a cell is about to\ndivide, the chromatin coils tightly and condenses to\nform chromosomes.', 'This nuclear envelope is studded with protein-\nlined pores that allow materials to be trafficked into\nand out of the nucleus.

DNA is normally found as a loosely\ncontained structure called chromatin within the\nnucleus, where it is wound up and associated with a\nvariety of histone proteins. When a cell is about to\ndivide, the chromatin coils tightly and condenses to\nform chromosomes.\nThere is a pool of cells constantly dividing within your\nbody. The result is billions of new cells being created\neach day. Before any cell is ready to divide, it must\nreplicate its DNA so that each new daughter cell will\nreceive an exact copy of the organism’s genome. A\nvariety of enzymes are enlisted during DNA replication.\nThese enzymes unwind the DNA molecule, separate\nthe two strands, and assist with the building of\ncomplementary strands along each parent strand. The\noriginal DNA strands serve as templates from which\nthe nucleotide sequence of the new strands are\ndetermined and synthesized. When replication is\ncompleted, two identical DNA molecules exist. Each\none contains one original strand and one newly\nsynthesized complementary strand.\n3.4 Protein Synthesis\nDNA stores the information necessary for instructing\nthe cell to perform all of its functions. Cells use the\ngenetic code stored within DNA to build proteins,\nwhich ultimately determine the structure and function\nof the cell. This genetic code lies in the particular\nsequence of nucleotides that make up each gene along\nthe DNA molecule. To “read” this code, the cell must\nperform two sequential steps. In the first step,\ntranscription, the DNA code is converted into an RNA\ncode. A molecule of messenger RNA that is\ncomplementary to a specific gene is synthesized in a\nprocess similar to DNA replication. The molecule of\nmRNA provides the code to synthesize a protein. In the\nprocess of translation, the mRNA attaches to a\nribosome. Next, tRNA molecules shuttle the\nappropriate amino acids to the ribosome, one-by-one,\ncoded by sequential triplet codons on the mRNA, until\nthe protein is fully synthesized.', 'Each\ncell is spindle shaped with a single nucleus and no visible striations (Figure 4.18).\n148\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 4.18\nMuscle Tissue\n(a) Skeletal muscle cells have prominent striation and nuclei on their periphery.

Two main classes of cells make up nervous tissue: the neuron and neuroglia\n(Figure 4.19). Neurons propagate information via electrochemical impulses, called action potentials, which are\nbiochemically linked to the release of chemical signals. Neuroglia play an essential role in supporting neurons and\nmodulating their information propagation.\n4.5 • Nervous Tissue Mediates Perception and Response\n149\nFIGURE 4.19\nThe Neuron\nThe cell body of a neuron, also called the soma, contains the nucleus and mitochondria.

This\ninformation is stored within DNA. The nucleus sends “commands” to the cell via molecular messengers that\ntranslate the information from DNA. Each cell in your body (with the exception of germ cells) contains the complete\nset of your DNA. When a cell divides, the DNA must be duplicated so that the each new cell receives a full\ncomplement of DNA. The following section will explore the structure of the nucleus and its contents, as well as the\nprocess of DNA replication.\nOrganization of the Nucleus and Its DNA\nLike most other cellular organelles, the nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear envelope. This\nmembranous covering consists of two adjacent lipid bilayers with a thin fluid space in between them. Spanning\nthese two bilayers are nuclear pores. A nuclear pore is a tiny passageway for the passage of proteins, RNA, and\nsolutes between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Proteins called pore complexes lining the nuclear pores regulate\n3.3 • The Nucleus and DNA Replication\n99\nthe passage of materials into and out of the nucleus.\nInside the nuclear envelope is a gel-like nucleoplasm with solutes that include the building blocks of nucleic acids.\nThere also can be a dark-staining mass often visible under a simple light microscope, called a nucleolus (plural =\nnucleoli). The nucleolus is a region of the nucleus that is responsible for manufacturing the RNA necessary for\nconstruction of ribosomes. Once synthesized, newly made ribosomal subunits exit the cell’s nucleus through the\nnuclear pores.\nThe genetic instructions that are used to build and maintain an organism are arranged in an orderly manner in\nstrands of DNA. Within the nucleus are threads of chromatin composed of DNA and associated proteins (Figure\n3.22). Along the chromatin threads, the DNA is wrapped around a set of histone proteins. A nucleosome is a single,\nwrapped DNA-histone complex. Multiple nucleosomes along the entire molecule of DNA appear like a beaded\nnecklace, in which the string is the DNA and the beads are the associated histones.', 'RBCs\neject their nuclei as they mature, making space for the large numbers of hemoglobin molecules that carry oxygen\nthroughout the body (Figure 3.21). Without nuclei, the life span of RBCs is short, and so the body must produce new\nones constantly.\nFIGURE 3.19\nThe Nucleus\nThe nucleus is the control center of the cell.

An\nunderstanding of anatomy and physiology is not only fundamental to any career in the health professions, but it can\nalso benefit your own health. Familiarity with the human body can help you make healthful choices and prompt you\nto take appropriate action when signs of illness arise. Your knowledge in this field will help you understand news\nabout nutrition, medications, medical devices, and procedures and help you understand genetic or infectious\ndiseases. At some point, everyone will have a problem with some aspect of their body and your knowledge can help\nyou to be a better parent, spouse, partner, friend, colleague, or caregiver.\nThis chapter begins with an overview of anatomy and physiology and a preview of the body regions and functions. It\nthen covers the characteristics of life and how the body works to maintain stable conditions. It introduces a set of\nstandard terms for body structures and for planes and positions in the body that will serve as a foundation for more\ncomprehensive information covered later in the text. It ends with examples of medical imaging used to see inside\nthe living body.', 'For example, a systemic anatomical study of the muscular system\nwould consider all of the skeletal muscles of the body.\nWhereas anatomy is about structure, physiology is about function. Human physiology is the scientific study of the\nchemistry and physics of the structures of the body and the ways in which they work together to support the\nfunctions of life. Much of the study of physiology centers on the body’s tendency toward homeostasis. Homeostasis\nis the state of steady internal conditions maintained by living things. The study of physiology certainly includes\nobservation, both with the naked eye and with microscopes, as well as manipulations and measurements. However,\ncurrent advances in physiology usually depend on carefully designed laboratory experiments that reveal the\n8\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nfunctions of the many structures and chemical compounds that make up the human body.\nLike anatomists, physiologists typically specialize in a particular branch of physiology. For example, neurophysiology\nis the study of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves and how these work together to perform functions as complex and\ndiverse as vision, movement, and thinking. Physiologists may work from the organ level (exploring, for example,\nwhat different parts of the brain do) to the molecular level (such as exploring how an electrochemical signal travels\nalong nerves).\nForm is closely related to function in all living things. For example, the thin flap of your eyelid can snap down to clear\naway dust particles and almost instantaneously slide back up to allow you to see again. At the microscopic level, the\narrangement and function of the nerves and muscles that serve the eyelid allow for its quick action and retreat. At a\nsmaller level of analysis, the function of these nerves and muscles likewise relies on the interactions of specific\nmolecules and ions. Even the three-dimensional structure of certain molecules is essential to their function.\nYour study of anatomy and physiology will make more sense if you continually relate the form of the structures you\nare studying to their function. In fact, it can be somewhat frustrating to attempt to study anatomy without an\nunderstanding of the physiology that a body structure supports. Imagine, for example, trying to appreciate the\nunique arrangement of the bones of the human hand if you had no conception of the function of the hand.', '1 Overview of Anatomy and Physiology\nHuman anatomy is the scientific study of the body’s\nstructures. In the past, anatomy has primarily been\nstudied via observing injuries, and later by the\ndissection of anatomical structures of cadavers, but in\nthe past century, computer-assisted imaging\ntechniques have allowed clinicians to look inside the\nliving body. Human physiology is the scientific study of\nthe chemistry and physics of the structures of the body.\nPhysiology explains how the structures of the body\nwork together to maintain life. It is difficult to study\nstructure (anatomy) without knowledge of function\n(physiology). The two disciplines are typically studied\ntogether because form and function are closely related\nin all living things.\n1.2 Structural Organization of the Human\nBody\nLife processes of the human body are maintained at\nseveral levels of structural organization. These include\nthe chemical, cellular, tissue, organ, organ system, and\nthe organism level. Higher levels of organization are\nbuilt from lower levels. Therefore, molecules combine\nto form cells, cells combine to form tissues, tissues\ncombine to form organs, organs combine to form organ\nsystems, and organ systems combine to form\norganisms.\n1.3 Functions of Human Life\nMost processes that occur in the human body are not\n1 • Chapter Review\n33\nconsciously controlled. They occur continuously to\nbuild, maintain, and sustain life. These processes\ninclude: organization, in terms of the maintenance of\nessential body boundaries; metabolism, including\nenergy transfer via anabolic and catabolic reactions;\nresponsiveness; movement; and growth,\ndifferentiation, reproduction, and renewal.\n1.4 Requirements for Human Life\nHumans cannot survive for more than a few minutes\nwithout oxygen, for more than several days without\nwater, and for more than several weeks without\ncarbohydrates, lipids, proteins, vitamins, and minerals.\nAlthough the body can respond to high temperatures\nby sweating and to low temperatures by shivering and\nincreased fuel consumption, long-term exposure to\nextreme heat and cold is not compatible with survival.\nThe body requires a precise atmospheric pressure to\nmaintain its gases in solution and to facilitate\nrespiration—the intake of oxygen and the release of\ncarbon dioxide. Humans also require blood pressure\nhigh enough to ensure that blood reaches all body\ntissues but low enough to avoid damage to blood\nvessels.', 'The\nimprovements have been informed by extensive\nfeedback from adopting faculty, curricular innovators,\nand equity experts.\nThe revision includes the following core changes:\n•\nIn explanations of endocrine function,\nreproduction, development, inheritance, and\nrelated topics, the second edition is clearer and\nmore accurate in differentiations related to sex,\nand eliminates incorrect equivalencies and\ngeneralizations regarding sex and gender.\nOpenStax thanks Sam Long and River Suh,\nfounders of Gender-Inclusive Biology, for their\nextensive guidance and support\n•\nMany of the illustrations have been improved to be\nmore representative of diverse populations.

Some of these structures are very small and can\nonly be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a microscope. Other larger structures can readily be seen,\nmanipulated, measured, and weighed. The word “anatomy” comes from a Greek root that means “to cut apart.”\nHuman anatomy was first studied by observing the exterior of the body and observing the wounds of soldiers and\nother injuries. Later, physicians were allowed to dissect bodies of the dead to augment their knowledge. When a\nbody is dissected, its structures are cut apart in order to observe their physical attributes and their relationships to\none another. Dissection is still used in medical schools, anatomy courses, and in pathology labs. In order to observe\nstructures in living people, however, a number of imaging techniques have been developed. These techniques allow\nclinicians to visualize structures inside the living body such as a cancerous tumor or a fractured bone.\nLike most scientific disciplines, anatomy has areas of specialization. Gross anatomy is the study of the larger\nstructures of the body, those visible without the aid of magnification (Figure 1.2 a). Macro- means “large,” thus,\ngross anatomy is also referred to as macroscopic anatomy. In contrast, micro- means “small,” and microscopic\nanatomy is the study of structures that can be observed only with the use of a microscope or other magnification\ndevices (Figure 1.2 b).', 'Contents\nPreface\n1\nUNIT 1 LEVELS OF ORGANIZATION\nCHAPTER 1\nAn Introduction to the Human Body\n7\nIntroduction\n7\n1.1 Overview of Anatomy and Physiology\n8\n1.2 Structural Organization of the Human Body\n9\n1.3 Functions of Human Life\n14\n1.4 Requirements for Human Life\n16\n1.5 Homeostasis\n20\n1.6 Anatomical Terminology\n23\n1.7 Medical Imaging\n28\nKey Terms\n32\nChapter Review\n33\nInteractive Link Questions\n34\nReview Questions\n35\nCritical Thinking Questions\n36\nCHAPTER 2\nThe Chemical Level of Organization\n39\nIntroduction\n39\n2.1 Elements and Atoms: The Building Blocks of Matter\n40\n2.2 Chemical Bonds\n47\n2.3 Chemical Reactions\n51\n2.4 Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n54\n2.5 Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n61\nKey Terms\n75\nChapter Review\n76\nInteractive Link Questions\n78\nReview Questions\n78\nCritical Thinking Questions\n80\nCHAPTER 3\nThe Cellular Level of Organization\n81\nIntroduction\n81\n3.1 The Cell Membrane\n82\n3.2 The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles\n91\n3.3 The Nucleus and DNA Replication\n98\n3.4 Protein Synthesis\n103\n3.5 Cell Growth and Division\n107\n3.6 Cellular Differentiation\n112\nKey Terms\n116\nChapter Review\n118\nInteractive Link Questions\n120\nReview Questions\n120\nCritical Thinking Questions\n122\nCHAPTER 4\nThe Tissue Level of Organization\n125\nIntroduction\n125\n4.1 Types of Tissues\n126\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\n130\n4.3 Connective Tissue Supports and Protects\n140\n4.4 Muscle Tissue and Motion\n147\n4.5 Nervous Tissue Mediates Perception and Response\n149\n4.6 Tissue Injury and Aging\n151\nKey Terms\n155\nChapter Review\n157\nInteractive Link Questions\n159\nReview Questions\n159\nCritical Thinking Questions\n160\nUNIT 2 SUPPORT AND MOVEMENT\nCHAPTER 5\nThe Integumentary System\n163\nIntroduction\n163\n5.1 Layers of the Skin\n163\n5.']","Students first explore specific systems of the body in Unit 2: Support and Movement, which includes Chapters 5–11, focusing on the integumentary, skeletal, and muscular systems.","In Unit 2: Support and Movement, specifically in Chap ters 5–11."

Prone describes a face-down orientation, and\nsupine describes a face up orientation. These terms are sometimes used in describing the position of the body\nduring specific physical examinations or surgical procedures.\nRegional Terms\nThe human body’s numerous regions have specific terms to help increase precision (see Figure 1.12). Notice that\nthe term “brachium” or “arm” is reserved for the “upper arm” and “antebrachium” or “forearm” is used rather than\n“lower arm.” Similarly, “femur” or “thigh” is correct, and “leg” or “crus” is reserved for the portion of the lower limb\nbetween the knee and the ankle. You will be able to describe the body’s regions using the terms from the figure.\nDirectional Terms\nCertain directional anatomical terms appear throughout this and any other anatomy textbook (Figure 1.13). These\nterms are essential for describing the relative locations of different body structures. For instance, an anatomist\nmight describe one band of tissue as “inferior to” another or a physician might describe a tumor as “superficial to” a\ndeeper body structure.

The cells within a tissue share a\ncommon embryonic origin. Microscopic observation reveals that the cells in a tissue share morphological features\nand are arranged in an orderly pattern that achieves the tissue’s functions. From the evolutionary perspective,\ntissues appear in more complex organisms. For example, multicellular protists, ancient eukaryotes, do not have\ncells organized into tissues.\nAlthough there are many types of cells in the human body, they are organized into four broad categories of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands.', '1 Types of Tissues\nThe human body contains more than 200 types of cells\nthat can all be classified into four types of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Epithelial\ntissues act as coverings controlling the movement of\nmaterials across the surface. Connective tissue\nintegrates the various parts of the body and provides\nsupport and protection to organs. Muscle tissue allows\nthe body to move. Nervous tissues propagate\ninformation.\nThe study of the shape and arrangement of cells in\ntissue is called histology. All cells and tissues in the\nbody derive from three germ layers in the embryo: the\nectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm.\nDifferent types of tissues form membranes that\nenclose organs, provide a friction-free interaction\nbetween organs, and keep organs together. Synovial\nmembranes are connective tissue membranes that\nprotect and line the joints. Epithelial membranes are\nformed from epithelial tissue attached to a layer of\nconnective tissue. There are three types of epithelial\nmembranes: mucous, which contain glands; serous,\nwhich secrete fluid; and cutaneous which makes up the\nskin.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nIn epithelial tissue, cells are closely packed with little\nor no extracellular matrix except for the basal lamina\nthat separates the epithelium from underlying tissue.\nThe main functions of epithelia are protection from the\nenvironment, coverage, secretion and excretion,\nabsorption, and filtration. Cells are bound together by\ntight junctions that form an impermeable barrier. They\ncan also be connected by gap junctions, which allow\nfree exchange of soluble molecules between cells, and\nanchoring junctions, which attach cell to cell or cell to\nmatrix. The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream.', 'Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands. Connective tissue, as its name implies, binds the\ncells and organs of the body together and functions in the protection, support, and integration of all parts of the\nbody. Muscle tissue is excitable, responding to stimulation and contracting to provide movement, and occurs as\nthree major types: skeletal (voluntary) muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle in the heart. Nervous tissue is\nalso excitable, allowing the propagation of electrochemical signals in the form of nerve impulses that communicate\nbetween different regions of the body (Figure 4.2).\nThe next level of organization is the organ, where several types of tissues come together to form a working unit. Just\nas knowing the structure and function of cells helps you in your study of tissues, knowledge of tissues will help you\nunderstand how organs function.

What is the narrow range of body temperature within which the body's chemical reactions can take place?,"['In contrast, micronutrients are vitamins and minerals. These elements and compounds participate in\nmany essential chemical reactions and processes, such as nerve impulses, and some, such as calcium, also\ncontribute to the body’s structure. Your body can store some of the micronutrients in its tissues, and draw on those\nreserves if you fail to consume them in your diet for a few days or weeks. Some others micronutrients, such as\nvitamin C and most of the B vitamins, are water-soluble and cannot be stored, so you need to consume them every\nday or two.\nNarrow Range of Temperature\nYou have probably seen news stories about athletes who died of heat stroke, or hikers who died of exposure to cold.\nSuch deaths occur because the chemical reactions upon which the body depends can only take place within a\nnarrow range of body temperature, from just below to just above 37°C (98.6°F). When body temperature rises well\nabove or drops well below normal, certain proteins (enzymes) that facilitate chemical reactions lose their normal\nstructure and their ability to function and the chemical reactions of metabolism cannot proceed.\nThat said, the body can respond effectively to short-term exposure to heat (Figure 1.8) or cold. One of the body’s\nresponses to heat is, of course, sweating. As sweat evaporates from skin, it removes some thermal energy from the\nbody, cooling it. Adequate water (from the extracellular fluid in the body) is necessary to produce sweat, so\nadequate fluid intake is essential to balance that loss during the sweat response. Not surprisingly, the sweat\nresponse is much less effective in a humid environment because the air is already saturated with water. Thus, the\nsweat on the skin’s surface is not able to evaporate, and internal body temperature can get dangerously high.\n1.4 • Requirements for Human Life\n17\nFIGURE 1.8\nExtreme Heat\nHumans acclimate to some degree to repeated exposure to high temperatures. (credit: McKay Savage/flickr)\nThe body can also respond effectively to short-term exposure to cold. One response to cold is shivering, which is\nrandom muscle movement that generates heat. Another response is increased breakdown of stored energy to\ngenerate heat.', 'Controlled hypothermia often is used, for example, during open-heart surgery because it decreases the\nmetabolic needs of the brain, heart, and other organs, reducing the risk of damage to them. When controlled\nhypothermia is used clinically, the patient is given medication to prevent shivering. The body is then cooled to\n25–32°C (79–89°F). The heart is stopped and an external heart-lung pump maintains circulation to the patient’s\nbody. The heart is cooled further and is maintained at a temperature below 15°C (60°F) for the duration of the\nsurgery. This very cold temperature helps the heart muscle to tolerate its lack of blood supply during the\nsurgery.\nSome emergency department physicians use controlled hypothermia to reduce damage to the heart in patients\nwho have suffered a cardiac arrest. In the emergency department, the physician induces coma and lowers the\npatient’s body temperature to approximately 91 degrees. This condition, which is maintained for 24 hours,\nslows the patient’s metabolic rate. Because the patient’s organs require less blood to function, the heart’s\nworkload is reduced.\n18\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNarrow Range of Atmospheric Pressure\nPressure is a force exerted by a substance that is in contact with another substance. Atmospheric pressure is\npressure exerted by the mixture of gases (primarily nitrogen and oxygen) in the Earth’s atmosphere. Although you\nmay not perceive it, atmospheric pressure is constantly pressing down on your body. This pressure keeps gases\nwithin your body, such as the gaseous nitrogen in body fluids, dissolved. If you were suddenly ejected from a space\nship above Earth’s atmosphere, you would go from a situation of normal pressure to one of very low pressure. The\npressure of the nitrogen gas in your blood would be much higher than the pressure of nitrogen in the space\nsurrounding your body. As a result, the nitrogen gas in your blood would expand, forming bubbles that could block\nblood vessels and even cause cells to break apart.\nAtmospheric pressure does more than just keep blood gases dissolved. Your ability to breathe—that is, to take in\noxygen and release carbon dioxide—also depends upon a precise atmospheric pressure.', 'As a general rule, gases tend to react faster than liquids or\nsolids, again because it takes energy to separate particles of a substance, and gases by definition already have\nspace between their particles. Similarly, the larger the molecule, the greater the number of total bonds, so reactions\ninvolving smaller molecules, with fewer total bonds, would be expected to proceed faster.\nIn addition, recall that some elements are more reactive than others. Reactions that involve highly reactive\nelements like hydrogen proceed more quickly than reactions that involve less reactive elements. Reactions involving\nstable elements like helium are not likely to happen at all.\nTemperature\nNearly all chemical reactions occur at a faster rate at higher temperatures. Recall that kinetic energy is the energy of\nmatter in motion. The kinetic energy of subatomic particles increases in response to increases in thermal energy.\nThe higher the temperature, the faster the particles move, and the more likely they are to come in contact and react.\n2.3 • Chemical Reactions\n53\nConcentration and Pressure\nIf just a few people are dancing at a club, they are unlikely to step on each other’s toes. But as more and more\npeople get up to dance—especially if the music is fast—collisions are likely to occur. It is the same with chemical\nreactions: the more particles present within a given space, the more likely those particles are to bump into one\nanother. This means that chemists can speed up chemical reactions not only by increasing the concentration of\nparticles—the number of particles in the space—but also by decreasing the volume of the space, which would\ncorrespondingly increase the pressure. If there were 100 dancers in that club, and the manager abruptly moved the\nparty to a room half the size, the concentration of the dancers would double in the new space, and the likelihood of\ncollisions would increase accordingly.\nEnzymes and Other Catalysts\nFor two chemicals in nature to react with each other they first have to come into contact, and this occurs through\nrandom collisions. Because heat helps increase the kinetic energy of atoms, ions, and molecules, it promotes their\ncollision. But in the body, extremely high heat—such as a very high fever—can damage body cells and be life-\nthreatening. On the other hand, normal body temperature is not high enough to promote the chemical reactions that\nsustain life. That is where catalysts come in.', 'Enzymes and Other Catalysts\nFor two chemicals in nature to react with each other they first have to come into contact, and this occurs through\nrandom collisions.

But in the body, extremely high heat—such as a very high fever—can damage body cells and be life-\nthreatening. On the other hand, normal body temperature is not high enough to promote the chemical reactions that\nsustain life. That is where catalysts come in.\nIn chemistry, a catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any\nchange. You can think of a catalyst as a chemical change agent. They help increase the rate and force at which\natoms, ions, and molecules collide, thereby increasing the probability that their valence shell electrons will interact.\nThe most important catalysts in the human body are enzymes. An enzyme is a catalyst composed of protein or\nribonucleic acid (RNA), both of which will be discussed later in this chapter. Like all catalysts, enzymes work by\nlowering the level of energy that needs to be invested in a chemical reaction. A chemical reaction’s activation\nenergy is the “threshold” level of energy needed to break the bonds in the reactants. Once those bonds are broken,\nnew arrangements can form. Without an enzyme to act as a catalyst, a much larger investment of energy is needed\nto ignite a chemical reaction (Figure 2.13).\nFIGURE 2.13\nEnzymes\nEnzymes decrease the activation energy required for a given chemical reaction to occur. (a) Without an enzyme,\nthe energy input needed for a reaction to begin is high. (b) With the help of an enzyme, less energy is needed for a reaction to begin.\nEnzymes are critical to the body’s healthy functioning. They assist, for example, with the breakdown of food and its\nconversion to energy. In fact, most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by enzymes.', 'There are two\ntypes of reactions that accomplish this: anabolism and catabolism.\n•\nAnabolism is the process whereby smaller, simpler molecules are combined into larger, more complex\nsubstances. Your body can assemble, by utilizing energy, the complex chemicals it needs by combining small\nmolecules derived from the foods you eat\n•\nCatabolism is the process by which larger more complex substances are broken down into smaller simpler\nmolecules. Catabolism releases energy. The complex molecules found in foods are broken down so the body\ncan use their parts to assemble the structures and substances needed for life.\nTaken together, these two processes are called metabolism. Metabolism is the sum of all anabolic and catabolic\nreactions that take place in the body (Figure 1.6). Both anabolism and catabolism occur simultaneously and\ncontinuously to keep you alive.\n14\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 1.6\nMetabolism\nAnabolic reactions are building reactions, and they consume energy. Catabolic reactions break materials down\nand release energy. Metabolism includes both anabolic and catabolic reactions.\nEvery cell in your body makes use of a chemical compound, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to store and release\nenergy. The cell stores energy in the synthesis (anabolism) of ATP, then moves the ATP molecules to the location\nwhere energy is needed to fuel cellular activities.

An\nexample of responsiveness to external stimuli could include moving toward sources of food and water and away\nfrom perceived dangers. Changes in an organism’s internal environment, such as increased body temperature, can\ncause the responses of sweating and the dilation of blood vessels in the skin in order to decrease body temperature,\nas shown by the runners in Figure 1.7.']",The narrow range of body temperature within which the body's chemical reactions can take place is just below to just above 37°C (98.6°F).,from just below to just above 37°C (98.6°F)
What is the body's response to heat that involves the evaporation of sweat from the skin?,"['This rich innervation\nhelps us sense our environment and react accordingly.\nFIGURE 5.15\nLight Micrograph of a Meissner Corpuscle\nIn this micrograph of a skin cross-section, you can see a Meissner corpuscle\n(arrow), a type of touch receptor located in a dermal papilla adjacent to the basement membrane and stratum basale of the overlying\nepidermis.

The sympathetic\nnervous system is continuously monitoring body temperature and initiating appropriate motor responses. Recall\nthat sweat glands, accessory structures to the skin, secrete water, salt, and other substances to cool the body when\nit becomes warm. Even when the body does not appear to be noticeably sweating, approximately 500 mL of sweat\n(insensible perspiration) are secreted a day. If the body becomes excessively warm due to high temperatures,\nvigorous activity (Figure 5.16ac), or a combination of the two, sweat glands will be stimulated by the sympathetic\nnervous system to produce large amounts of sweat, as much as 0.7 to 1.5 L per hour for an active person. When the\nsweat evaporates from the skin surface, the body is cooled as body heat is dissipated.\nIn addition to sweating, arterioles in the dermis dilate so that excess heat carried by the blood can dissipate through\nthe skin and into the surrounding environment (Figure 5.16b). This accounts for the skin redness that many people\nexperience when exercising.\n178\n5 • The Integumentary System\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 5.16\nThermoregulation\nDuring strenuous physical activities, such as skiing (a) or running (c), the dermal blood vessels dilate\nand sweat secretion increases (b). These mechanisms prevent the body from overheating.

(credit: McKay Savage/flickr)\nThe body can also respond effectively to short-term exposure to cold. One response to cold is shivering, which is\nrandom muscle movement that generates heat. Another response is increased breakdown of stored energy to\ngenerate heat. When that energy reserve is depleted, however, and the core temperature begins to drop\nsignificantly, red blood cells will lose their ability to give up oxygen, denying the brain of this critical component of\nATP production. This lack of oxygen can cause confusion, lethargy, and eventually loss of consciousness and death.\nThe body responds to cold by reducing blood circulation to the extremities, the hands and feet, in order to prevent\nblood from cooling there and so that the body’s core can stay warm. Even when core body temperature remains\nstable, however, tissues exposed to severe cold, especially the fingers and toes, can develop frostbite when blood\nflow to the extremities has been much reduced. This form of tissue damage can be permanent and lead to gangrene,\nrequiring amputation of the affected region.\nEveryday Connection\nControlled Hypothermia\nAs you have learned, the body continuously engages in coordinated physiological processes to maintain a stable\ntemperature. In some cases, however, overriding this system can be useful, or even life-saving. Hypothermia is\nthe clinical term for an abnormally low body temperature (hypo- = “below” or “under”). Controlled hypothermia\nis clinically induced hypothermia performed in order to reduce the metabolic rate of an organ or of a person’s\nentire body.\nControlled hypothermia often is used, for example, during open-heart surgery because it decreases the\nmetabolic needs of the brain, heart, and other organs, reducing the risk of damage to them. When controlled\nhypothermia is used clinically, the patient is given medication to prevent shivering. The body is then cooled to\n25–32°C (79–89°F). The heart is stopped and an external heart-lung pump maintains circulation to the patient’s\nbody.', 'The insulin signals skeletal muscle fibers, fat cells (adipocytes), and liver cells to take up the excess glucose,\nremoving it from the bloodstream. As glucose concentration in the bloodstream drops, the decrease in\nconcentration—the actual negative feedback—is detected by pancreatic alpha cells, and insulin release stops. This\nprevents blood sugar levels from continuing to drop below the normal range.\nHumans have a similar temperature regulation feedback system that works by promoting either heat loss or heat\ngain (Figure 1.10b). When the brain’s temperature regulation center receives data from the sensors indicating that\nthe body’s temperature exceeds its normal range, it stimulates a cluster of brain cells referred to as the “heat-loss\ncenter.” This stimulation has three major effects:\n•\nBlood vessels in the skin begin to dilate allowing more blood from the body core to flow to the surface of the\nskin allowing the heat to radiate into the environment.\n•\nAs blood flow to the skin increases, sweat glands are activated to increase their output. As the sweat\nevaporates from the skin surface into the surrounding air, it takes heat with it.\n•\nThe depth of respiration increases, and a person may breathe through an open mouth instead of through the\nnasal passageways. This further increases heat loss from the lungs.\nIn contrast, activation of the brain’s heat-gain center by exposure to cold reduces blood flow to the skin, and blood\nreturning from the limbs is diverted into a network of deep veins. This arrangement traps heat closer to the body\ncore and restricts heat loss. If heat loss is severe, the brain triggers an increase in random signals to skeletal\nmuscles, causing them to contract and producing shivering. The muscle contractions of shivering release heat while\nusing up ATP. The brain triggers the thyroid gland in the endocrine system to release thyroid hormone, which\nincreases metabolic activity and heat production in cells throughout the body. The brain also signals the adrenal\nglands to release epinephrine (adrenaline), a hormone that causes the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which\ncan be used as an energy source. The breakdown of glycogen into glucose also results in increased metabolism and\nheat production.\n1.5 • Homeostasis\n21\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nWater concentration in the body is critical for proper functioning.', 'In contrast, micronutrients are vitamins and minerals. These elements and compounds participate in\nmany essential chemical reactions and processes, such as nerve impulses, and some, such as calcium, also\ncontribute to the body’s structure. Your body can store some of the micronutrients in its tissues, and draw on those\nreserves if you fail to consume them in your diet for a few days or weeks. Some others micronutrients, such as\nvitamin C and most of the B vitamins, are water-soluble and cannot be stored, so you need to consume them every\nday or two.\nNarrow Range of Temperature\nYou have probably seen news stories about athletes who died of heat stroke, or hikers who died of exposure to cold.\nSuch deaths occur because the chemical reactions upon which the body depends can only take place within a\nnarrow range of body temperature, from just below to just above 37°C (98.6°F). When body temperature rises well\nabove or drops well below normal, certain proteins (enzymes) that facilitate chemical reactions lose their normal\nstructure and their ability to function and the chemical reactions of metabolism cannot proceed.\nThat said, the body can respond effectively to short-term exposure to heat (Figure 1.8) or cold. One of the body’s\nresponses to heat is, of course, sweating. As sweat evaporates from skin, it removes some thermal energy from the\nbody, cooling it. Adequate water (from the extracellular fluid in the body) is necessary to produce sweat, so\nadequate fluid intake is essential to balance that loss during the sweat response. Not surprisingly, the sweat\nresponse is much less effective in a humid environment because the air is already saturated with water. Thus, the\nsweat on the skin’s surface is not able to evaporate, and internal body temperature can get dangerously high.\n1.4 • Requirements for Human Life\n17\nFIGURE 1.8\nExtreme Heat\nHumans acclimate to some degree to repeated exposure to high temperatures.

(credit a: “Trysil”/flickr; credit c: Ralph Daily)\nWhen body temperatures drop, the arterioles constrict to minimize heat loss, particularly in the ends of the digits\nand tip of the nose. This reduced circulation can result in the skin taking on a whitish hue. Although the temperature\nof the skin drops as a result, passive heat loss is prevented, and internal organs and structures remain warm. If the\ntemperature of the skin drops too much (such as environmental temperatures below freezing), the conservation of\nbody core heat can result in the skin actually freezing, a condition called frostbite.\nAging and the...\nIntegumentary System\nAll systems in the body accumulate subtle and some not-so-subtle changes as a person ages. Among these\nchanges are reductions in cell division, metabolic activity, blood circulation, hormonal levels, and muscle\nstrength (Figure 5.17). In the skin, these changes are reflected in decreased mitosis in the stratum basale,\nleading to a thinner epidermis. The dermis, which is responsible for the elasticity and resilience of the skin,\nexhibits a reduced ability to regenerate, which leads to slower wound healing. The hypodermis, with its fat\nstores, loses structure due to the reduction and redistribution of fat, which in turn contributes to the thinning\nand sagging of skin.\nFIGURE 5.17\nAging\nGenerally, skin, especially on the face and hands, starts to display the first noticeable signs of aging, as it loses\nits elasticity over time.

Most\nglands consist of groups of epithelial cells. A gland can be classified as an endocrine gland, a ductless gland that\nreleases secretions directly into surrounding tissues and fluids (endo- = “inside”), or an exocrine gland whose\nsecretions leave through a duct that opens directly, or indirectly, to the external environment (exo- = “outside”).\nEndocrine Glands\nThe secretions of endocrine glands are called hormones. Hormones are released into the interstitial fluid, diffused\ninto the bloodstream, and delivered to targets, in other words, cells that have receptors to bind the hormones. The\nendocrine system is part of a major regulatory system coordinating the regulation and integration of body\nresponses. A few examples of endocrine glands include the anterior pituitary, thymus, adrenal cortex, and gonads.\nExocrine Glands\nExocrine glands release their contents through a duct that leads to the epithelial surface. Mucous, sweat, saliva, and\nbreast milk are all examples of secretions from exocrine glands. They are all discharged through tubular ducts.\nSecretions into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, technically outside of the body, are of the exocrine category.', 'A few examples of endocrine glands include the anterior pituitary, thymus, adrenal cortex, and gonads.\nExocrine Glands\nExocrine glands release their contents through a duct that leads to the epithelial surface.

The unicellular glands are scattered single cells,\nsuch as goblet cells, found in the mucous membranes of the small and large intestine.\nThe multicellular exocrine glands known as serous glands develop from simple epithelium to form a secretory\nsurface that secretes directly into an inner cavity. These glands line the internal cavities of the abdomen and chest\nand release their secretions directly into the cavities. Other multicellular exocrine glands release their contents\nthrough a tubular duct. The duct is single in a simple gland but in compound glands is divided into one or more\nbranches (Figure 4.9). In tubular glands, the ducts can be straight or coiled, whereas tubes that form pockets are\nalveolar (acinar), such as the exocrine portion of the pancreas. Combinations of tubes and pockets are known as\ntubuloalveolar (tubuloacinar) compound glands.

Merocrine secretion is the most common type of\nexocrine secretion. The secretions are enclosed in vesicles that move to the apical surface of the cell where the\ncontents are released by exocytosis.

These glands are\nfound all over the skin’s surface, but are especially abundant on the palms of the hand, the soles of the feet, and the\nforehead (Figure 5.14). They are coiled glands lying deep in the dermis, with the duct rising up to a pore on the skin\nsurface, where the sweat is released. This type of sweat, released by exocytosis, is hypotonic and composed mostly\nof water, with some salt, antibodies, traces of metabolic waste, and dermicidin, an antimicrobial peptide. Eccrine\nglands are a primary component of thermoregulation in humans and thus help to maintain homeostasis.\nFIGURE 5.14\nEccrine Gland\nEccrine glands are coiled glands in the dermis that release sweat that is mostly water.\nAn apocrine sweat gland is usually associated with hair follicles in densely hairy areas, such as armpits and genital\nregions. Apocrine sweat glands are larger than eccrine sweat glands and lie deeper in the dermis, sometimes even\nreaching the hypodermis, with the duct normally emptying into the hair follicle. In addition to water and salts,\napocrine sweat includes organic compounds that make the sweat thicker and subject to bacterial decomposition\nand subsequent smell. The release of this sweat is under both nervous and hormonal control, and plays a role in the\npoorly understood human pheromone response. Most commercial antiperspirants use an aluminum-based\ncompound as their primary active ingredient to stop sweat.

In the posterior\n(dorsal) cavity, the cranial cavity houses the brain, and the spinal cavity (or vertebral cavity) encloses the spinal\ncord. Just as the brain and spinal cord make up a continuous, uninterrupted structure, the cranial and spinal cavities\nthat house them are also continuous. The brain and spinal cord are protected by the bones of the skull and vertebral\ncolumn and by cerebrospinal fluid, a colorless fluid produced by the brain, which cushions the brain and spinal cord\nwithin the posterior (dorsal) cavity.\nThe anterior (ventral) cavity has two main subdivisions: the thoracic cavity and the abdominopelvic cavity (see\nFigure 1.15). The thoracic cavity is the more superior subdivision of the anterior cavity, and it is enclosed by the rib\ncage. The thoracic cavity contains the lungs and the heart, which is located in the mediastinum. The diaphragm\nforms the floor of the thoracic cavity and separates it from the more inferior abdominopelvic cavity. The\nabdominopelvic cavity is the largest cavity in the body. Although no membrane physically divides the\nabdominopelvic cavity, it can be useful to distinguish between the abdominal cavity, the division that houses the\ndigestive organs, and the pelvic cavity, the division that houses the organs of reproduction.', 'In the areas of the skeleton where bones move (for example, the ribcage and joints),\ncartilage, a semi-rigid form of connective tissue, provides flexibility and smooth surfaces for movement. The\nskeletal system is the body system composed of bones and cartilage and performs the following critical functions\nfor the human body:\nFigure 6.1\nChild Looking at Bones Bone is a living tissue.

Simply by\nlooking at a person, you can see how the bones support, facilitate movement, and protect the human body.\nJust as the steel beams of a building provide a scaffold to support its weight, the bones and cartilage of your\nskeletal system compose the scaffold that supports the rest of your body. Without the skeletal system, you would be\na limp mass of organs, muscle, and skin.\nBones also facilitate movement by serving as points of attachment for your muscles. While some bones only serve\nas a support for the muscles, others also transmit the forces produced when your muscles contract. From a\nmechanical point of view, bones act as levers and joints serve as fulcrums (Figure 6.2). Unless a muscle spans a\njoint and contracts, a bone is not going to move.

Spinal curvatures can also be excessive dorsoventrally (kyphosis) causing a hunch back and thoracic\ncompression. These curvatures often appear in preteens as the result of poor posture, abnormal growth, or\nindeterminate causes. Mostly, they are readily treated by orthopedists. As people age, accumulated spinal column\ninjuries and diseases like osteoporosis can also lead to curvatures of the spine, hence the stooping you sometimes\nsee in the elderly.\nSome orthopedists sub-specialize in sports medicine, which addresses both simple injuries, such as a sprained\nankle, and complex injuries, such as a torn rotator cuff in the shoulder. Treatment can range from exercise to\nsurgery.\nMineral Storage, Energy Storage, and Hematopoiesis\nOn a metabolic level, bone tissue performs several critical functions. For one, the bone matrix acts as a reservoir for\na number of minerals important to the functioning of the body, especially calcium, and phosphorus. These minerals,\nincorporated into bone tissue, can be released back into the bloodstream to maintain levels needed to support\nphysiological processes. Calcium ions, for example, are essential for muscle contractions and controlling the flow of\nother ions involved in the transmission of nerve impulses.\nBone also serves as a site for fat storage and blood cell production. The softer connective tissue that fills the interior\nof most bone is referred to as bone marrow (Figure 6.5). There are two types of bone marrow: yellow marrow and\nred marrow. Yellow marrow contains adipose tissue; the triglycerides stored in the adipocytes of the tissue can\nserve as a source of energy. Red marrow is where hematopoiesis—the production of blood cells—takes place. Red\nblood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are all produced in the red marrow.\nFIGURE 6.5\nHead of Femur Showing Red and Yellow Marrow\nThe head of the femur contains both yellow and red marrow.', 'For information on the interaction of the skeletal and muscular\nsystems, that is, the musculoskeletal system, seek additional content.\nFIGURE 6.2\nBones Support Movement\nBones act as levers when muscles span a joint and contract.

Although the first PET scanner was introduced in 1961, it took 15 more years before\nradiopharmaceuticals were combined with the technique and revolutionized its potential. The main advantage is\nthat PET (see Figure 1.19c) can illustrate physiologic activity—including nutrient metabolism and blood flow—of the\norgan or organs being targeted, whereas CT and MRI scans can only show static images. PET is widely used to\ndiagnose a multitude of conditions, such as heart disease, the spread of cancer, certain forms of infection, brain\nabnormalities, bone disease, and thyroid disease.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nPET relies on radioactive substances administered several minutes before the scan.

How is PET used in chemotherapy?\nUltrasonography\nUltrasonography is an imaging technique that uses the transmission of high-frequency sound waves into the body\nto generate an echo signal that is converted by a computer into a real-time image of anatomy and physiology (see\nFigure 1.19d). Ultrasonography is the least invasive of all imaging techniques, and it is therefore used more freely in\nsensitive situations such as pregnancy. The technology was first developed in the 1940s and 1950s.\nUltrasonography is used to study heart function, blood flow in the neck or extremities, certain conditions such as\ngallbladder disease, and fetal growth and development. The main disadvantages of ultrasonography are that the\nimage quality is heavily operator-dependent and that it is unable to penetrate bone and gas.\n1.', 'He applied for a patent for the first MRI scanning device,\nwhich was in use clinically by the early 1980s. The early MRI scanners were crude, but advances in digital\ncomputing and electronics led to their advancement over any other technique for precise imaging, especially to\ndiscover tumors. MRI also has the major advantage of not exposing patients to radiation.\nDrawbacks of MRI scans include their much higher cost, and patient discomfort with the procedure. The MRI\nscanner subjects the patient to such powerful electromagnets that the scan room must be shielded. The patient\n30\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nmust be enclosed in a metal tube-like device for the duration of the scan (see Figure 1.19b), sometimes as long as\nthirty minutes, which can be uncomfortable and impractical for ill patients. The device is also so noisy that, even\nwith earplugs, patients can become anxious or even fearful. These problems have been overcome somewhat with\nthe development of “open” MRI scanning, which does not require the patient to be entirely enclosed in the metal\ntube.

For more information, see the Career Connections.\nCAREER CONNECTION\nInterventional Radiologist\nThe controlled use of radioisotopes has advanced medical diagnosis and treatment of disease. Interventional\nradiologists are physicians who treat disease by using minimally invasive techniques involving radiation. Many\nconditions that could once only be treated with a lengthy and traumatic operation can now be treated non-\nsurgically, reducing the cost, pain, length of hospital stay, and recovery time for patients. For example, in the past,\nthe only options for a patient with one or more tumors in the liver were surgery and chemotherapy (the\nadministration of drugs to treat cancer). Some liver tumors, however, are difficult to access surgically, and others\ncould require the surgeon to remove too much of the liver. Moreover, chemotherapy is highly toxic to the liver, and\ncertain tumors do not respond well to it anyway. In some such cases, an interventional radiologist can treat the\ntumors by disrupting their blood supply, which they need if they are to continue to grow. In this procedure, called\nradioembolization, the radiologist accesses the liver with a fine needle, threaded through one of the patient’s blood\nvessels. The radiologist then inserts tiny radioactive “seeds” into the blood vessels that supply the tumors. In the\ndays and weeks following the procedure, the radiation emitted from the seeds destroys the vessels and directly kills\nthe tumor cells in the vicinity of the treatment.\nRadioisotopes emit subatomic particles that can be detected and tracked by imaging technologies. One of the most\nadvanced uses of radioisotopes in medicine is the positron emission tomography (PET) scanner, which detects the\nactivity in the body of a very small injection of radioactive glucose, the simple sugar that cells use for energy. The\nPET camera reveals to the medical team which of the patient’s tissues are taking up the most glucose. Thus, the\nmost metabolically active tissues show up as bright “hot spots” on the images (Figure 2.6). PET can reveal some\ncancerous masses because cancer cells consume glucose at a high rate to fuel their rapid reproduction.', 'One of the most\nadvanced uses of radioisotopes in medicine is the positron emission tomography (PET) scanner, which detects the\nactivity in the body of a very small injection of radioactive glucose, the simple sugar that cells use for energy.

Rather, they are constantly reacting with other\natoms to form and to break down more complex substances. To fully understand anatomy and physiology you must\ngrasp how atoms participate in such reactions. The key is understanding the behavior of electrons.\nAlthough electrons do not follow rigid orbits a set distance away from the atom’s nucleus, they do tend to stay\nwithin certain regions of space called electron shells. An electron shell is a layer of electrons that encircle the\nnucleus at a distinct energy level.\nThe atoms of the elements found in the human body have from one to five electron shells, and all electron shells\nhold eight electrons except the first shell, which can only hold two. This configuration of electron shells is the same\nfor all atoms. The precise number of shells depends on the number of electrons in the atom. Hydrogen and helium\nhave just one and two electrons, respectively. If you take a look at the periodic table of the elements, you will notice\nthat hydrogen and helium are placed alone on either sides of the top row; they are the only elements that have just\none electron shell (Figure 2.7). A second shell is necessary to hold the electrons in all elements larger than hydrogen\nand helium.\nLithium (Li), whose atomic number is 3, has three electrons.', 'The body’s\norgans are organized in one of two main\ncavities—dorsal (also referred to posterior) and ventral\n(also referred to anterior)—which are further sub-\ndivided according to the structures present in each\narea.

Ultrasonography is the least invasive of all imaging techniques, and it is therefore used more freely in\nsensitive situations such as pregnancy. The technology was first developed in the 1940s and 1950s.\nUltrasonography is used to study heart function, blood flow in the neck or extremities, certain conditions such as\ngallbladder disease, and fetal growth and development. The main disadvantages of ultrasonography are that the\nimage quality is heavily operator-dependent and that it is unable to penetrate bone and gas.\n1.', 'Ultrasonography is the least invasive of all imaging techniques, and it is therefore used more freely in\nsensitive situations such as pregnancy.

Watch this video (http://openstax.org/l/tattoo) to learn more about tattooing.\nSensory Function\nThe fact that you can feel an ant crawling on your skin, allowing you to flick it off before it bites, is because the skin,\nand especially the hairs projecting from hair follicles in the skin, can sense changes in the environment. The hair root\nplexus surrounding the base of the hair follicle senses a disturbance, and then transmits the information to the\ncentral nervous system (brain and spinal cord), which can then respond by activating the skeletal muscles of your\neyes to see the ant and the skeletal muscles of the body to act against the ant.\nThe skin acts as a sense organ because the epidermis, dermis, and the hypodermis contain specialized sensory\nnerve structures that detect touch, surface temperature, and pain. These receptors are more concentrated on the\ntips of the fingers, which are most sensitive to touch, especially the Meissner corpuscle (tactile corpuscle) (Figure\n5.15), which responds to light touch, and the Pacinian corpuscle (lamellated corpuscle), which responds to\nEveryday Connection\nTattoos and Piercings\nThe word “armor” evokes several images.

When radiofrequency pulses are applied, these protons are knocked out of alignment and then emit signals as they return to their original state, which are used to generate detailed images of the body's internal structures.","Magnets in an MRI are used to align hydrogen atoms in the body, producing detailed images of internal structures."
What is the smallest quantity of an element that retains its unique properties?,"['The same is true for neutrons and electrons. So, what gives an\nelement its distinctive properties—what makes carbon so different from sodium or iron? The answer is the unique\nquantity of protons each contains. Carbon by definition is an element whose atoms contain six protons. No other\nelement has exactly six protons in its atoms. Moreover, all atoms of carbon, whether found in your liver or in a lump\nof coal, contain six protons. Thus, the atomic number, which is the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom,\nidentifies the element. Because an atom usually has the same number of electrons as protons, the atomic number\nidentifies the usual number of electrons as well.\nIn their most common form, many elements also contain the same number of neutrons as protons. The most\ncommon form of carbon, for example, has six neutrons as well as six protons, for a total of 12 subatomic particles in\nits nucleus. An element’s mass number is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. So the\nmost common form of carbon’s mass number is 12. (Electrons have so little mass that they do not appreciably\ncontribute to the mass of an atom.) Carbon is a relatively light element.

This principle is referred to as the octet rule, and it states that an atom will give\nup, gain, or share electrons with another atom so that it ends up with eight electrons in its own valence shell.

The new grouping is typically more stable—less likely to react again—than its component atoms\nwere when they were separate. A more or less stable grouping of two or more atoms held together by chemical\nbonds is called a molecule. The bonded atoms may be of the same element, as in the case of H2, which is called\nmolecular hydrogen or hydrogen gas. When a molecule is made up of two or more atoms of different elements, it is\ncalled a chemical compound. Thus, a unit of water, or H2O, is a compound, as is a single molecule of the gas\nmethane, or CH4.\nThree types of chemical bonds are important in human physiology, because they hold together substances that are\nused by the body for critical aspects of homeostasis, signaling, and energy production, to name just a few important\nprocesses. These are ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds.\nIons and Ionic Bonds\nRecall that an atom typically has the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons.\nAs long as this situation remains, the atom is electrically neutral. But when an atom participates in a chemical\nreaction that results in the donation or acceptance of one or more electrons, the atom will then become positively or\nnegatively charged. This happens frequently for most atoms in order to have a full valence shell, as described\npreviously. This can happen either by gaining electrons to fill a shell that is more than half-full, or by giving away\nelectrons to empty a shell that is less than half-full, thereby leaving the next smaller electron shell as the new, full,\nvalence shell.

A positively charged ion is known as a cation.\nNow consider fluorine (F), a component of bones and teeth. Its atomic number is nine, and it has seven electrons in\nits valence shell. Thus, it is highly likely to bond with other atoms in such a way that fluorine accepts one electron (it\nis easier for fluorine to gain one electron than to donate seven electrons).

Hydrogen and helium\nhave just one and two electrons, respectively. If you take a look at the periodic table of the elements, you will notice\nthat hydrogen and helium are placed alone on either sides of the top row; they are the only elements that have just\none electron shell (Figure 2.7). A second shell is necessary to hold the electrons in all elements larger than hydrogen\nand helium.\nLithium (Li), whose atomic number is 3, has three electrons. Two of these fill the first electron shell, and the third\nspills over into a second shell. The second electron shell can accommodate as many as eight electrons. Carbon, with\nits six electrons, entirely fills its first shell, and half-fills its second. With ten electrons, neon (Ne) entirely fills its two\nelectron shells. Again, a look at the periodic table reveals that all of the elements in the second row, from lithium to\nneon, have just two electron shells. Atoms with more than ten electrons require more than two shells. These\nelements occupy the third and subsequent rows of the periodic table.\n2.1 • Elements and Atoms: The Building Blocks of Matter\n45\nFIGURE 2.7\nElectron Shells\nElectrons orbit the atomic nucleus at distinct levels of energy called electron shells. (a) With one electron,\nhydrogen only half-fills its electron shell. Helium also has a single shell, but its two electrons completely fill it. (b) The electrons of carbon\ncompletely fill its first electron shell, but only half-fills its second. (c) Neon, an element that does not occur in the body, has 10 electrons,\nfilling both of its electron shells.\nThe factor that most strongly governs the tendency of an atom to participate in chemical reactions is the number of\nelectrons in its valence shell. A valence shell is an atom’s outermost electron shell. If the valence shell is full, the\natom is stable; meaning its electrons are unlikely to be pulled away from the nucleus by the electrical charge of\nother atoms. If the valence shell is not full, the atom is reactive; meaning it will tend to react with other atoms in\nways that make the valence shell full.', 'One of the most\nadvanced uses of radioisotopes in medicine is the positron emission tomography (PET) scanner, which detects the\nactivity in the body of a very small injection of radioactive glucose, the simple sugar that cells use for energy. The\nPET camera reveals to the medical team which of the patient’s tissues are taking up the most glucose. Thus, the\nmost metabolically active tissues show up as bright “hot spots” on the images (Figure 2.6). PET can reveal some\ncancerous masses because cancer cells consume glucose at a high rate to fuel their rapid reproduction.\n44\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 2.6\nPET Scan\nPET highlights areas in the body where there is relatively high glucose use, which is characteristic of cancerous\ntissue. This PET scan shows sites of the spread of a large primary tumor to other sites.\nThe Behavior of Electrons\nIn the human body, atoms do not exist as independent entities. Rather, they are constantly reacting with other\natoms to form and to break down more complex substances. To fully understand anatomy and physiology you must\ngrasp how atoms participate in such reactions. The key is understanding the behavior of electrons.\nAlthough electrons do not follow rigid orbits a set distance away from the atom’s nucleus, they do tend to stay\nwithin certain regions of space called electron shells. An electron shell is a layer of electrons that encircle the\nnucleus at a distinct energy level.\nThe atoms of the elements found in the human body have from one to five electron shells, and all electron shells\nhold eight electrons except the first shell, which can only hold two. This configuration of electron shells is the same\nfor all atoms. The precise number of shells depends on the number of electrons in the atom. Hydrogen and helium\nhave just one and two electrons, respectively. If you take a look at the periodic table of the elements, you will notice\nthat hydrogen and helium are placed alone on either sides of the top row; they are the only elements that have just\none electron shell (Figure 2.7). A second shell is necessary to hold the electrons in all elements larger than hydrogen\nand helium.\nLithium (Li), whose atomic number is 3, has three electrons.', 'Protons and\nneutrons contribute nearly all of an atom’s mass; the\nnumber of protons and neutrons is an element’s mass\nnumber. Heavier and lighter versions of the same\nelement can occur in nature because these versions\nhave different numbers of neutrons. Different versions\nof an element are called isotopes.\nThe tendency of an atom to be stable or to react readily\nwith other atoms is largely due to the behavior of the\nelectrons within the atom’s outermost electron shell,\ncalled its valence shell. Helium, as well as larger atoms\nwith eight electrons in their valence shell, is unlikely to\nparticipate in chemical reactions because they are\nstable. All other atoms tend to accept, donate, or share\nelectrons in a process that brings the electrons in their\nvalence shell to eight (or in the case of hydrogen, to\ntwo).\n2.2 Chemical Bonds\nEach moment of life, atoms of oxygen, carbon,\nhydrogen, and the other elements of the human body\nare making and breaking chemical bonds. Ions are\ncharged atoms that form when an atom donates or\naccepts one or more negatively charged electrons.\nCations (ions with a positive charge) are attracted to\nanions (ions with a negative charge). This attraction is\ncalled an ionic bond. In covalent bonds, the\nparticipating atoms do not lose or gain electrons, but\nrather share them. Molecules with nonpolar covalent\nbonds are electrically balanced, and have a linear\n76\n2 • Chapter Review\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nthree-dimensional shape. Molecules with polar\ncovalent bonds have “poles”—regions of weakly\npositive and negative charge—and have a triangular\nthree-dimensional shape. An atom of oxygen and two\natoms of hydrogen form water molecules by means of\npolar covalent bonds. Hydrogen bonds link hydrogen\natoms already participating in polar covalent bonds to\nanions or electronegative regions of other polar\nmolecules. Hydrogen bonds link water molecules,\nresulting in the properties of water that are important\nto living things.\n2.3 Chemical Reactions\nChemical reactions, in which chemical bonds are\nbroken and formed, require an initial investment of\nenergy.', 'INTERACTIVE LINK\nVisit this website (http://openstax.org/l/electenergy) to learn about electrical energy and the attraction/repulsion of\ncharges. What happens to the charged electroscope when a conductor is moved between its plastic sheets, and\nwhy?\nPotassium (K), for instance, is an important element in all body cells. Its atomic number is 19. It has just one\nelectron in its valence shell. This characteristic makes potassium highly likely to participate in chemical reactions in\nwhich it donates one electron. (It is easier for potassium to donate one electron than to gain seven electrons.) The\nloss will cause the positive charge of potassium’s protons to be more influential than the negative charge of\npotassium’s electrons. In other words, the resulting potassium ion will be slightly positive. A potassium ion is\nwritten K+, indicating that it has lost a single electron. A positively charged ion is known as a cation.\nNow consider fluorine (F), a component of bones and teeth. Its atomic number is nine, and it has seven electrons in\nits valence shell. Thus, it is highly likely to bond with other atoms in such a way that fluorine accepts one electron (it\nis easier for fluorine to gain one electron than to donate seven electrons). When it does, its electrons will outnumber\nits protons by one, and it will have an overall negative charge. The ionized form of fluorine is called fluoride, and is\nwritten as F–. A negatively charged ion is known as an anion.\n2.2 • Chemical Bonds\n47\nAtoms that have more than one electron to donate or accept will end up with stronger positive or negative charges.\nA cation that has donated two electrons has a net charge of +2. Using magnesium (Mg) as an example, this can be\nwritten Mg++ or Mg2+. An anion that has accepted two electrons has a net charge of –2. The ionic form of selenium\n(Se), for example, is typically written Se2–.\nThe opposite charges of cations and anions exert a moderately strong mutual attraction that keeps the atoms in\nclose proximity forming an ionic bond. An ionic bond is an ongoing, close association between ions of opposite\ncharge. The table salt you sprinkle on your food owes its existence to ionic bonding.']","The number of electrons in an atom's valence shell most strongly governs its tendency to participate in chemical reactions. If the valence shell is full, the atom is stable and less likely to react; if it is not full, the atom is reactive and will seek to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve stability.",The number of electrons in its valence shell is the factor most strongly governing the tendency of an atom to participate in chemical reactions.
What is a hydrogen bond?,"['A bond is a weak or strong electrical attraction that holds atoms in\nthe same vicinity. The new grouping is typically more stable—less likely to react again—than its component atoms\nwere when they were separate. A more or less stable grouping of two or more atoms held together by chemical\nbonds is called a molecule. The bonded atoms may be of the same element, as in the case of H2, which is called\nmolecular hydrogen or hydrogen gas. When a molecule is made up of two or more atoms of different elements, it is\ncalled a chemical compound. Thus, a unit of water, or H2O, is a compound, as is a single molecule of the gas\nmethane, or CH4.\nThree types of chemical bonds are important in human physiology, because they hold together substances that are\nused by the body for critical aspects of homeostasis, signaling, and energy production, to name just a few important\nprocesses. These are ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds.\nIons and Ionic Bonds\nRecall that an atom typically has the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons.\nAs long as this situation remains, the atom is electrically neutral. But when an atom participates in a chemical\nreaction that results in the donation or acceptance of one or more electrons, the atom will then become positively or\nnegatively charged. This happens frequently for most atoms in order to have a full valence shell, as described\npreviously. This can happen either by gaining electrons to fill a shell that is more than half-full, or by giving away\nelectrons to empty a shell that is less than half-full, thereby leaving the next smaller electron shell as the new, full,\nvalence shell. An atom that has an electrical charge—whether positive or negative—is an ion.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nVisit this website (http://openstax.org/l/electenergy) to learn about electrical energy and the attraction/repulsion of\ncharges.

Water molecules also repel\nmolecules with nonpolar covalent bonds, like fats, lipids, and oils. You can demonstrate this with a simple kitchen\nexperiment: pour a teaspoon of vegetable oil, a compound formed by nonpolar covalent bonds, into a glass of water.', 'Polar Covalent Bonds\nGroups of legislators with completely opposite views on a particular issue are often described as “polarized” by\nnews writers. In chemistry, a polar molecule is a molecule that contains regions that have opposite electrical\ncharges. Polar molecules occur when atoms share electrons unequally, in polar covalent bonds.\n2.2 • Chemical Bonds\n49\nThe most familiar example of a polar molecule is water (Figure 2.10). The molecule has three parts: one atom of\noxygen, the nucleus of which contains eight protons, and two hydrogen atoms, whose nuclei each contain only one\nproton. Because every proton exerts an identical positive charge, a nucleus that contains eight protons exerts a\ncharge eight times greater than a nucleus that contains one proton. This means that the negatively charged\nelectrons present in the water molecule are more strongly attracted to the oxygen nucleus than to the hydrogen\nnuclei. Each hydrogen atom’s single negative electron therefore migrates toward the oxygen atom, making the\noxygen end of their bond slightly more negative than the hydrogen end of their bond.\nFIGURE 2.10\nPolar Covalent Bonds in a Water Molecule\nWhat is true for the bonds is true for the water molecule as a whole; that is, the oxygen region has a slightly negative\ncharge and the regions of the hydrogen atoms have a slightly positive charge. These charges are often referred to as\n“partial charges” because the strength of the charge is less than one full electron, as would occur in an ionic bond.\nAs shown in Figure 2.10, regions of weak polarity are indicated with the Greek letter delta (δ) and a plus (+) or minus\n(–) sign.\nEven though a single water molecule is unimaginably tiny, it has mass, and the opposing electrical charges on the\nmolecule pull that mass in such a way that it creates a shape somewhat like a triangular tent (see Figure 2.10b).\nThis dipole, with the positive charges at one end formed by the hydrogen atoms at the “bottom” of the tent and the\nnegative charge at the opposite end (the oxygen atom at the “top” of the tent) makes the charged regions highly\nlikely to interact with charged regions of other polar molecules.

Kinetic energy, the energy of matter in motion,\nfuels the collisions of atoms, ions, and molecules that\nare necessary if their old bonds are to break and new\nones to form. All molecules store potential energy,\nwhich is released when their bonds are broken.\nFour forms of energy essential to human functioning\nare: chemical energy, which is stored and released as\nchemical bonds are formed and broken; mechanical\nenergy, which directly powers physical activity; radiant\nenergy, emitted as waves such as in sunlight; and\nelectrical energy, the power of moving electrons.\nChemical reactions begin with reactants and end with\nproducts. Synthesis reactions bond reactants together,\na process that requires energy, whereas decomposition\nreactions break the bonds within a reactant and\nthereby release energy. In exchange reactions, bonds\nare both broken and formed, and energy is exchanged.\nThe rate at which chemical reactions occur is\ninfluenced by several properties of the reactants:\ntemperature, concentration and pressure, and the\npresence or absence of a catalyst. An enzyme is a\ncatalytic protein that speeds up chemical reactions in\nthe human body.\n2.4 Inorganic Compounds Essential to\nHuman Functioning\nInorganic compounds essential to human functioning\ninclude water, salts, acids, and bases.

Salts are compounds\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\nsolution, making it more acidic.

Like next-door\nneighbors whose kids hang out first at one home and then at the other, the atoms do not lose or gain electrons\npermanently. Instead, the electrons move back and forth between the elements.

Notice that the two covalently bonded atoms typically\nshare just one or two electron pairs, though larger sharings are possible. The important concept to take from this is\nthat in covalent bonds, electrons in the two atoms' overlapping atomic orbitals are shared to fill the valence shells of\nboth atoms, ultimately stabilizing both of the atoms involved. In a single covalent bond, a single electron pair is\nshared between two atoms, while in a double covalent bond, two pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms.\nThere even are triple covalent bonds, where three electron pairs are shared between two atoms.\nFIGURE 2.9\nCovalent Bonding\nYou can see that the covalent bonds shown in Figure 2.9 are balanced.

What is a catalyst?,"['Enzymes and Other Catalysts\nFor two chemicals in nature to react with each other they first have to come into contact, and this occurs through\nrandom collisions. Because heat helps increase the kinetic energy of atoms, ions, and molecules, it promotes their\ncollision. But in the body, extremely high heat—such as a very high fever—can damage body cells and be life-\nthreatening. On the other hand, normal body temperature is not high enough to promote the chemical reactions that\nsustain life. That is where catalysts come in.\nIn chemistry, a catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any\nchange. You can think of a catalyst as a chemical change agent. They help increase the rate and force at which\natoms, ions, and molecules collide, thereby increasing the probability that their valence shell electrons will interact.\nThe most important catalysts in the human body are enzymes. An enzyme is a catalyst composed of protein or\nribonucleic acid (RNA), both of which will be discussed later in this chapter. Like all catalysts, enzymes work by\nlowering the level of energy that needs to be invested in a chemical reaction. A chemical reaction’s activation\nenergy is the “threshold” level of energy needed to break the bonds in the reactants. Once those bonds are broken,\nnew arrangements can form. Without an enzyme to act as a catalyst, a much larger investment of energy is needed\nto ignite a chemical reaction (Figure 2.13).\nFIGURE 2.13\nEnzymes\nEnzymes decrease the activation energy required for a given chemical reaction to occur. (a) Without an enzyme,\nthe energy input needed for a reaction to begin is high. (b) With the help of an enzyme, less energy is needed for a reaction to begin.\nEnzymes are critical to the body’s healthy functioning. They assist, for example, with the breakdown of food and its\nconversion to energy. In fact, most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by enzymes.', 'As a general rule, gases tend to react faster than liquids or\nsolids, again because it takes energy to separate particles of a substance, and gases by definition already have\nspace between their particles. Similarly, the larger the molecule, the greater the number of total bonds, so reactions\ninvolving smaller molecules, with fewer total bonds, would be expected to proceed faster.\nIn addition, recall that some elements are more reactive than others. Reactions that involve highly reactive\nelements like hydrogen proceed more quickly than reactions that involve less reactive elements. Reactions involving\nstable elements like helium are not likely to happen at all.\nTemperature\nNearly all chemical reactions occur at a faster rate at higher temperatures. Recall that kinetic energy is the energy of\nmatter in motion. The kinetic energy of subatomic particles increases in response to increases in thermal energy.\nThe higher the temperature, the faster the particles move, and the more likely they are to come in contact and react.\n2.3 • Chemical Reactions\n53\nConcentration and Pressure\nIf just a few people are dancing at a club, they are unlikely to step on each other’s toes. But as more and more\npeople get up to dance—especially if the music is fast—collisions are likely to occur. It is the same with chemical\nreactions: the more particles present within a given space, the more likely those particles are to bump into one\nanother. This means that chemists can speed up chemical reactions not only by increasing the concentration of\nparticles—the number of particles in the space—but also by decreasing the volume of the space, which would\ncorrespondingly increase the pressure. If there were 100 dancers in that club, and the manager abruptly moved the\nparty to a room half the size, the concentration of the dancers would double in the new space, and the likelihood of\ncollisions would increase accordingly.\nEnzymes and Other Catalysts\nFor two chemicals in nature to react with each other they first have to come into contact, and this occurs through\nrandom collisions. Because heat helps increase the kinetic energy of atoms, ions, and molecules, it promotes their\ncollision. But in the body, extremely high heat—such as a very high fever—can damage body cells and be life-\nthreatening. On the other hand, normal body temperature is not high enough to promote the chemical reactions that\nsustain life. That is where catalysts come in.', 'Enzymes, introduced earlier as protein\ncatalysts, are examples of this. The next section takes a closer look at the action of enzymes.\nProteins Function as Enzymes\nIf you were trying to type a paper, and every time you hit a key on your laptop there was a delay of six or seven\nminutes before you got a response, you would probably get a new laptop. In a similar way, without enzymes to\ncatalyze chemical reactions, the human body would be nonfunctional. It functions only because enzymes function.\nEnzymatic reactions—chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes—begin when substrates bind to the enzyme. A\nsubstrate is a reactant in an enzymatic reaction. This occurs on regions of the enzyme known as active sites (Figure\n2.27). Any given enzyme catalyzes just one type of chemical reaction. This characteristic, called specificity, is due to\nthe fact that a substrate with a particular shape and electrical charge can bind only to an active site corresponding\nto that substrate.\nDue to this jigsaw puzzle-like match between an enzyme and its substrates, enzymes are known for their specificity.\nIn fact, as an enzyme binds to its substrate(s), the enzyme structure changes slightly to find the best fit between the\ntransition state (a structural intermediate between the substrate and product) and the active site, just as a rubber\nglove molds to a hand inserted into it. This active-site modification in the presence of substrate, along with the\nsimultaneous formation of the transition state, is called induced fit. Overall, there is a specifically matched enzyme\nfor each substrate and, thus, for each chemical reaction; however, there is some flexibility as well. Some enzymes\nhave the ability to act on several different structurally related substrates.\nFIGURE 2.27\nSteps in an Enzymatic Reaction\nAccording to the induced-fit model, the active site of the enzyme undergoes\nconformational changes upon binding with the substrate.(a) Substrates approach active sites on enzyme. (b) Substrates bind to active sites,\nproducing an enzyme–substrate complex. (c) Changes internal to the enzyme–substrate complex facilitate interaction of the substrates. (d)\nProducts are released and the enzyme returns to its original form, ready to facilitate another enzymatic reaction.\nBinding of a substrate produces an enzyme–substrate complex.', 'An exchange reaction is a chemical reaction in which both synthesis and decomposition occur, chemical bonds are\nboth formed and broken, and chemical energy is absorbed, stored, and released (see Figure 2.12c). The simplest\nform of an exchange reaction might be:\n. Notice that, to produce these products, B and C had to\nbreak apart in a decomposition reaction, whereas A and B had to bond in a synthesis reaction. A more complex\nexchange reaction might be:\n. Another example might be:\n.\nIn theory, any chemical reaction can proceed in either direction under the right conditions. Reactants may\nsynthesize into a product that is later decomposed. Reversibility is also a quality of exchange reactions. For instance,\ncould then reverse to\n. This reversibility of a chemical reaction is indicated\nwith a double arrow:\n. Still, in the human body, many chemical reactions do proceed in a\npredictable direction, either one way or the other. You can think of this more predictable path as the path of least\nresistance because, typically, the alternate direction requires more energy.\nFactors Influencing the Rate of Chemical Reactions\nIf you pour vinegar into baking soda, the reaction is instantaneous; the concoction will bubble and fizz. But many\nchemical reactions take time. A variety of factors influence the rate of chemical reactions. This section, however, will\nconsider only the most important in human functioning.\nProperties of the Reactants\nIf chemical reactions are to occur quickly, the atoms in the reactants have to have easy access to one another. Thus,\nthe greater the surface area of the reactants, the more readily they will interact. When you pop a cube of cheese into\nyour mouth, you chew it before you swallow it. Among other things, chewing increases the surface area of the food\nso that digestive chemicals can more easily get at it. As a general rule, gases tend to react faster than liquids or\nsolids, again because it takes energy to separate particles of a substance, and gases by definition already have\nspace between their particles. Similarly, the larger the molecule, the greater the number of total bonds, so reactions\ninvolving smaller molecules, with fewer total bonds, would be expected to proceed faster.\nIn addition, recall that some elements are more reactive than others. Reactions that involve highly reactive\nelements like hydrogen proceed more quickly than reactions that involve less reactive elements.', 'There are two\ntypes of reactions that accomplish this: anabolism and catabolism.\n•\nAnabolism is the process whereby smaller, simpler molecules are combined into larger, more complex\nsubstances. Your body can assemble, by utilizing energy, the complex chemicals it needs by combining small\nmolecules derived from the foods you eat\n•\nCatabolism is the process by which larger more complex substances are broken down into smaller simpler\nmolecules. Catabolism releases energy. The complex molecules found in foods are broken down so the body\ncan use their parts to assemble the structures and substances needed for life.\nTaken together, these two processes are called metabolism. Metabolism is the sum of all anabolic and catabolic\nreactions that take place in the body (Figure 1.6). Both anabolism and catabolism occur simultaneously and\ncontinuously to keep you alive.\n14\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 1.6\nMetabolism\nAnabolic reactions are building reactions, and they consume energy. Catabolic reactions break materials down\nand release energy. Metabolism includes both anabolic and catabolic reactions.\nEvery cell in your body makes use of a chemical compound, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to store and release\nenergy. The cell stores energy in the synthesis (anabolism) of ATP, then moves the ATP molecules to the location\nwhere energy is needed to fuel cellular activities. Then the ATP is broken down (catabolism) and a controlled\namount of energy is released, which is used by the cell to perform a particular job.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nView this animation (http://openstax.org/l/metabolic) to learn more about metabolic processes. Which organs of the\nbody likely carry out anabolic processes? What about catabolic processes?\nResponsiveness\nResponsiveness is the ability of an organism to adjust to changes in its internal and external environments. An\nexample of responsiveness to external stimuli could include moving toward sources of food and water and away\nfrom perceived dangers. Changes in an organism’s internal environment, such as increased body temperature, can\ncause the responses of sweating and the dilation of blood vessels in the skin in order to decrease body temperature,\nas shown by the runners in Figure 1.7.']","A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without undergoing any permanent change itself. In biological systems, enzymes serve as catalysts by lowering the activation energy required for reactions, thereby facilitating essential biochemical processes.",A substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any change.

You can think of a catalyst as a chemical change agent. They help increase the rate and force at which\natoms, ions, and molecules collide, thereby increasing the probability that their valence shell electrons will interact.\nThe most important catalysts in the human body are enzymes. An enzyme is a catalyst composed of protein or\nribonucleic acid (RNA), both of which will be discussed later in this chapter. Like all catalysts, enzymes work by\nlowering the level of energy that needs to be invested in a chemical reaction. A chemical reaction’s activation\nenergy is the “threshold” level of energy needed to break the bonds in the reactants. Once those bonds are broken,\nnew arrangements can form. Without an enzyme to act as a catalyst, a much larger investment of energy is needed\nto ignite a chemical reaction (Figure 2.13).\nFIGURE 2.13\nEnzymes\nEnzymes decrease the activation energy required for a given chemical reaction to occur. (a) Without an enzyme,\nthe energy input needed for a reaction to begin is high. (b) With the help of an enzyme, less energy is needed for a reaction to begin.\nEnzymes are critical to the body’s healthy functioning. They assist, for example, with the breakdown of food and its\nconversion to energy. In fact, most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by enzymes.', 'As a general rule, gases tend to react faster than liquids or\nsolids, again because it takes energy to separate particles of a substance, and gases by definition already have\nspace between their particles.

You can demonstrate this with a simple kitchen\nexperiment: pour a teaspoon of vegetable oil, a compound formed by nonpolar covalent bonds, into a glass of water.\nInstead of instantly dissolving in the water, the oil forms a distinct bead because the polar water molecules repel the\nnonpolar oil.\n2.3 Chemical Reactions\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDistinguish between kinetic and potential energy, and between exergonic and endergonic chemical reactions\n•\nIdentify four forms of energy important in human functioning\n•\nDescribe the three basic types of chemical reactions\n•\nIdentify several factors influencing the rate of chemical reactions\nOne characteristic of a living organism is metabolism, which is the sum total of all of the chemical reactions that go\non to maintain that organism’s health and life. The bonding processes you have learned thus far are anabolic\nchemical reactions; that is, they form larger molecules from smaller molecules or atoms. But recall that metabolism\ncan proceed in another direction: in catabolic chemical reactions, bonds between components of larger molecules\nbreak, releasing smaller molecules or atoms. Both types of reaction involve exchanges not only of matter, but of\nenergy.\nThe Role of Energy in Chemical Reactions\nChemical reactions require a sufficient amount of energy to cause the matter to collide with enough precision and\nforce that old chemical bonds can be broken and new ones formed. In general, kinetic energy is the form of energy\npowering any type of matter in motion. Imagine you are building a brick wall. The energy it takes to lift and place one\nbrick atop another is kinetic energy—the energy matter possesses because of its motion. Once the wall is in place, it\nstores potential energy. Potential energy is the energy of position, or the energy matter possesses because of the\npositioning or structure of its components. If the brick wall collapses, the stored potential energy is released as\nkinetic energy as the bricks fall.\nIn the human body, potential energy is stored in the bonds between atoms and molecules. Chemical energy is the\nform of potential energy in which energy is stored in chemical bonds. When those bonds are formed, chemical\nenergy is invested, and when they break, chemical energy is released.', 'Once the wall is in place, it\nstores potential energy. Potential energy is the energy of position, or the energy matter possesses because of the\npositioning or structure of its components. If the brick wall collapses, the stored potential energy is released as\nkinetic energy as the bricks fall.\nIn the human body, potential energy is stored in the bonds between atoms and molecules. Chemical energy is the\nform of potential energy in which energy is stored in chemical bonds. When those bonds are formed, chemical\nenergy is invested, and when they break, chemical energy is released. Notice that chemical energy, like all energy, is\nneither created nor destroyed; rather, it is converted from one form to another. When you eat an energy bar before\nheading out the door for a hike, the honey, nuts, and other foods the bar contains are broken down and rearranged\nby your body into molecules that your muscle cells convert to kinetic energy.\n2.3 • Chemical Reactions\n51\nChemical reactions that release more energy than they absorb are characterized as exergonic. The catabolism of the\nfoods in your energy bar is an example. Some of the chemical energy stored in the bar is absorbed into molecules\nyour body uses for fuel, but some of it is released—for example, as heat. In contrast, chemical reactions that absorb\nmore energy than they release are endergonic. These reactions require energy input, and the resulting molecule\nstores not only the chemical energy in the original components, but also the energy that fueled the reaction.\nBecause energy is neither created nor destroyed, where does the energy needed for endergonic reactions come\nfrom? In many cases, it comes from exergonic reactions.\nForms of Energy Important in Human Functioning\nYou have already learned that chemical energy is absorbed, stored, and released by chemical bonds. In addition to\nchemical energy, mechanical, radiant, and electrical energy are important in human functioning.\n•\nMechanical energy, which is stored in physical systems such as machines, engines, or the human body, directly\npowers the movement of matter. When you lift a brick into place on a wall, your muscles provide the mechanical\nenergy that moves the brick.\n•\nRadiant energy is energy emitted and transmitted as waves rather than matter. These waves vary in length from\nlong radio waves and microwaves to short gamma waves emitted from decaying atomic nuclei.', 'In addition to\nchemical energy, mechanical, radiant, and electrical energy are important in human functioning.\n•\nMechanical energy, which is stored in physical systems such as machines, engines, or the human body, directly\npowers the movement of matter.

These waves vary in length from\nlong radio waves and microwaves to short gamma waves emitted from decaying atomic nuclei. The full\nspectrum of radiant energy is referred to as the electromagnetic spectrum. The body uses the ultraviolet energy\nof sunlight to convert a compound in skin cells to vitamin D, which is essential to human functioning. The human\neye evolved to see the wavelengths that comprise the colors of the rainbow, from red to violet, so that range in\nthe spectrum is called “visible light.”\n•\nElectrical energy, supplied by electrolytes in cells and body fluids, contributes to the voltage changes that help\ntransmit impulses in nerve and muscle cells.\nCharacteristics of Chemical Reactions\nAll chemical reactions begin with a reactant, the general term for the one or more substances that enter into the\nreaction. Sodium and chloride ions, for example, are the reactants in the production of table salt. The one or more\nsubstances produced by a chemical reaction are called the product.\nIn chemical reactions, the components of the reactants—the elements involved and the number of atoms of\neach—are all present in the product(s). Similarly, there is nothing present in the products that are not present in the\nreactants. This is because chemical reactions are governed by the law of conservation of mass, which states that\nmatter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction.\nJust as you can express mathematical calculations in equations such as 2 + 7 = 9, you can use chemical equations\nto show how reactants become products. As in math, chemical equations proceed from left to right, but instead of\nan equal sign, they employ an arrow or arrows indicating the direction in which the chemical reaction proceeds. For\nexample, the chemical reaction in which one atom of nitrogen and three atoms of hydrogen produce ammonia would\nbe written as\n.']","The explanation of activation energy in the context of chemical reactions is located in the section discussing enzymes, where it describes how enzymes lower the activation energy needed for a chemical reaction to occur.",The explanation of the activation energy is located in the text where it is described as the 'threshold' level of energy needed to break the bonds in the reactants.
What is an acid?,"['A bond is a weak or strong electrical attraction that holds atoms in\nthe same vicinity. The new grouping is typically more stable—less likely to react again—than its component atoms\nwere when they were separate. A more or less stable grouping of two or more atoms held together by chemical\nbonds is called a molecule. The bonded atoms may be of the same element, as in the case of H2, which is called\nmolecular hydrogen or hydrogen gas. When a molecule is made up of two or more atoms of different elements, it is\ncalled a chemical compound. Thus, a unit of water, or H2O, is a compound, as is a single molecule of the gas\nmethane, or CH4.\nThree types of chemical bonds are important in human physiology, because they hold together substances that are\nused by the body for critical aspects of homeostasis, signaling, and energy production, to name just a few important\nprocesses. These are ionic bonds, covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds.\nIons and Ionic Bonds\nRecall that an atom typically has the same number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons.\nAs long as this situation remains, the atom is electrically neutral. But when an atom participates in a chemical\nreaction that results in the donation or acceptance of one or more electrons, the atom will then become positively or\nnegatively charged. This happens frequently for most atoms in order to have a full valence shell, as described\npreviously. This can happen either by gaining electrons to fill a shell that is more than half-full, or by giving away\nelectrons to empty a shell that is less than half-full, thereby leaving the next smaller electron shell as the new, full,\nvalence shell. An atom that has an electrical charge—whether positive or negative—is an ion.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nVisit this website (http://openstax.org/l/electenergy) to learn about electrical energy and the attraction/repulsion of\ncharges. What happens to the charged electroscope when a conductor is moved between its plastic sheets, and\nwhy?\nPotassium (K), for instance, is an important element in all body cells. Its atomic number is 19. It has just one\nelectron in its valence shell. This characteristic makes potassium highly likely to participate in chemical reactions in\nwhich it donates one electron.', '(b) In aqueous solution, a base dissociates into hydroxyl ions (OH–) and\ncations. Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–.\nBases\nA base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+ already present in\nsolution (see Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine\nwith H+ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+ and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases\nrelease most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H+. Food\nmixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract\nafter the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3–), a weak base that attracts H+. Bicarbonate\naccepts some of the H+ protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.\nThe Concept of pH\nThe relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution’s pH is the negative, base-10\nlogarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+\nconcentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times\nmore acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH.', 'Many other salts are important in the body. For example, bile salts produced by the liver help break apart dietary\nfats, and calcium phosphate salts form the mineral portion of teeth and bones.\nAcids and Bases\nAcids and bases, like salts, dissociate in water into electrolytes. Acids and bases can very much change the\nproperties of the solutions in which they are dissolved.\nAcids\nAn acid is a substance that releases hydrogen ions (H+) in solution (Figure 2.16a). Because an atom of hydrogen has\njust one proton and one electron, a positively charged hydrogen ion is simply a proton. This solitary proton is highly\nlikely to participate in chemical reactions. Strong acids are compounds that release all of their H+ in solution; that is,\nthey ionize completely. Hydrochloric acid (HCl), which is released from cells in the lining of the stomach, is a strong\nacid because it releases all of its H+ in the stomach’s watery environment. This strong acid aids in digestion and kills\ningested microbes. Weak acids do not ionize completely; that is, some of their hydrogen ions remain bonded within a\ncompound in solution. An example of a weak acid is vinegar, or acetic acid; it is called acetate after it gives up a\nproton.\n58\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 2.16\nAcids and Bases\n(a) In aqueous solution, an acid dissociates into hydrogen ions (H+) and anions.

A molecule of water is released as a byproduct during dehydration reactions. (b) In\nhydrolysis, the covalent bond between two monomers is split by the addition of a hydrogen atom to one and a hydroxyl group to the other,\nwhich requires the contribution of one molecule of water.\nSalts\nRecall that salts are formed when ions form ionic bonds. In these reactions, one atom gives up one or more\nelectrons, and thus becomes positively charged, whereas the other accepts one or more electrons and becomes\nnegatively charged. You can now define a salt as a substance that, when dissolved in water, dissociates into ions\nother than H+ or OH–. This fact is important in distinguishing salts from acids and bases, discussed next.\nA typical salt, NaCl, dissociates completely in water (Figure 2.15). The positive and negative regions on the water\nmolecule (the hydrogen and oxygen ends respectively) attract the negative chloride and positive sodium ions,\npulling them away from each other. Again, whereas nonpolar and polar covalently bonded compounds break apart\ninto molecules in solution, salts dissociate into ions. These ions are electrolytes; they are capable of conducting an\nelectrical current in solution. This property is critical to the function of ions in transmitting nerve impulses and\nprompting muscle contraction.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n57\nFIGURE 2.15\nDissociation of Sodium Chloride in Water\nNotice that the crystals of sodium chloride dissociate not into molecules of\nNaCl, but into Na+ cations and Cl– anions, each completely surrounded by water molecules.\nMany other salts are important in the body. For example, bile salts produced by the liver help break apart dietary\nfats, and calcium phosphate salts form the mineral portion of teeth and bones.\nAcids and Bases\nAcids and bases, like salts, dissociate in water into electrolytes. Acids and bases can very much change the\nproperties of the solutions in which they are dissolved.\nAcids\nAn acid is a substance that releases hydrogen ions (H+) in solution (Figure 2.16a).', 'This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids. For example, if there is\neven a slight decrease below 7.35 in the pH of a bodily fluid, the buffer in the fluid—in this case, acting as a weak\nbase—will bind the excess hydrogen ions. In contrast, if pH rises above 7.45, the buffer will act as a weak acid and\ncontribute hydrogen ions.\n60\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nHOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCES\nAcids and Bases\nExcessive acidity of the blood and other body fluids is known as acidosis. Common causes of acidosis are situations\nand disorders that reduce the effectiveness of breathing, especially the person’s ability to exhale fully, which causes\na buildup of CO2 (and H+) in the bloodstream. Acidosis can also be caused by metabolic problems that reduce the\nlevel or function of buffers that act as bases, or that promote the production of acids. For instance, with severe\ndiarrhea, too much bicarbonate can be lost from the body, allowing acids to build up in body fluids. In people with\npoorly managed diabetes (ineffective regulation of blood sugar), acids called ketones are produced as a form of\nbody fuel. These can build up in the blood, causing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Kidney failure,\nliver failure, heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.\nIn contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic). As with\nacidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low.\nLung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the\nnormal concentration of H+.']","An acid is a substance that releases hydrogen ions (H+) in solution. Strong acids ionize completely, while weak acids do not fully dissociate, retaining some hydrogen ions within a compound.","An acid is a substance that releases hydrogen ions (H+) in solution.

Food\nmixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract\nafter the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3–), a weak base that attracts H+. Bicarbonate\naccepts some of the H+ protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.\nThe Concept of pH\nThe relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution’s pH is the negative, base-10\nlogarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+\nconcentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times\nmore acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH.', 'An atom of oxygen and two\natoms of hydrogen form water molecules by means of\npolar covalent bonds. Hydrogen bonds link hydrogen\natoms already participating in polar covalent bonds to\nanions or electronegative regions of other polar\nmolecules. Hydrogen bonds link water molecules,\nresulting in the properties of water that are important\nto living things.\n2.3 Chemical Reactions\nChemical reactions, in which chemical bonds are\nbroken and formed, require an initial investment of\nenergy. Kinetic energy, the energy of matter in motion,\nfuels the collisions of atoms, ions, and molecules that\nare necessary if their old bonds are to break and new\nones to form. All molecules store potential energy,\nwhich is released when their bonds are broken.\nFour forms of energy essential to human functioning\nare: chemical energy, which is stored and released as\nchemical bonds are formed and broken; mechanical\nenergy, which directly powers physical activity; radiant\nenergy, emitted as waves such as in sunlight; and\nelectrical energy, the power of moving electrons.\nChemical reactions begin with reactants and end with\nproducts. Synthesis reactions bond reactants together,\na process that requires energy, whereas decomposition\nreactions break the bonds within a reactant and\nthereby release energy. In exchange reactions, bonds\nare both broken and formed, and energy is exchanged.\nThe rate at which chemical reactions occur is\ninfluenced by several properties of the reactants:\ntemperature, concentration and pressure, and the\npresence or absence of a catalyst. An enzyme is a\ncatalytic protein that speeds up chemical reactions in\nthe human body.\n2.4 Inorganic Compounds Essential to\nHuman Functioning\nInorganic compounds essential to human functioning\ninclude water, salts, acids, and bases. These\ncompounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain\nboth hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and\ncushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a\nbyproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a\nreactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\nsolution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H+,\nthereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).', '(a) In dehydration synthesis, two monomers are covalently bonded in a reaction in which one gives\nup a hydroxyl group and the other a hydrogen atom. A molecule of water is released as a byproduct during dehydration reactions. (b) In\nhydrolysis, the covalent bond between two monomers is split by the addition of a hydrogen atom to one and a hydroxyl group to the other,\nwhich requires the contribution of one molecule of water.\nSalts\nRecall that salts are formed when ions form ionic bonds. In these reactions, one atom gives up one or more\nelectrons, and thus becomes positively charged, whereas the other accepts one or more electrons and becomes\nnegatively charged. You can now define a salt as a substance that, when dissolved in water, dissociates into ions\nother than H+ or OH–. This fact is important in distinguishing salts from acids and bases, discussed next.\nA typical salt, NaCl, dissociates completely in water (Figure 2.15). The positive and negative regions on the water\nmolecule (the hydrogen and oxygen ends respectively) attract the negative chloride and positive sodium ions,\npulling them away from each other. Again, whereas nonpolar and polar covalently bonded compounds break apart\ninto molecules in solution, salts dissociate into ions. These ions are electrolytes; they are capable of conducting an\nelectrical current in solution. This property is critical to the function of ions in transmitting nerve impulses and\nprompting muscle contraction.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n57\nFIGURE 2.15\nDissociation of Sodium Chloride in Water\nNotice that the crystals of sodium chloride dissociate not into molecules of\nNaCl, but into Na+ cations and Cl– anions, each completely surrounded by water molecules.\nMany other salts are important in the body. For example, bile salts produced by the liver help break apart dietary\nfats, and calcium phosphate salts form the mineral portion of teeth and bones.\nAcids and Bases\nAcids and bases, like salts, dissociate in water into electrolytes. Acids and bases can very much change the\nproperties of the solutions in which they are dissolved.\nAcids\nAn acid is a substance that releases hydrogen ions (H+) in solution (Figure 2.16a).', 'FIGURE 2.13\nEnzymes\nEnzymes decrease the activation energy required for a given chemical reaction to occur. (a) Without an enzyme,\nthe energy input needed for a reaction to begin is high. (b) With the help of an enzyme, less energy is needed for a reaction to begin.\nEnzymes are critical to the body’s healthy functioning. They assist, for example, with the breakdown of food and its\nconversion to energy. In fact, most of the chemical reactions in the body are facilitated by enzymes.\n2.4 Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nCompare and contrast inorganic and organic compounds\n•\nIdentify the properties of water that make it essential to life\n•\nExplain the role of salts in body functioning\n•\nDistinguish between acids and bases, and explain their role in pH\n•\nDiscuss the role of buffers in helping the body maintain pH homeostasis\n54\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nThe concepts you have learned so far in this chapter govern all forms of matter, and would work as a foundation for\ngeology as well as biology.

In general, these compounds are either inorganic or\norganic.\n•\nAn inorganic compound is a substance that does not contain both carbon and hydrogen. A great many\ninorganic compounds do contain hydrogen atoms, such as water (H2O) and the hydrochloric acid (HCl)\nproduced by your stomach. In contrast, only a handful of inorganic compounds contain carbon atoms.

In the breakdown of glucose for energy, molecules of adenosine\ntriphosphate, better known as ATP, are produced. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is composed of a ribose sugar, an\nadenine base, and three phosphate groups. ATP releases free energy when its phosphate bonds are broken, and\nthus supplies ready energy to the cell. More ATP is produced in the presence of oxygen (O2) than in pathways that do\nnot use oxygen. The overall reaction for the conversion of the energy in glucose to energy stored in ATP can be\nwritten:\nIn addition to being a critical fuel source, carbohydrates are present in very small amounts in cells’ structure.

What distinguishes the 20 amino acids from one another?,"['While carbohydrates and lipids are composed of hydrocarbons and oxygen, all\nproteins also contain nitrogen (N), and many contain sulfur (S), in addition to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.\nMicrostructure of Proteins\nProteins are polymers made up of nitrogen-containing monomers called amino acids. An amino acid is a molecule\ncomposed of an amino group and a carboxyl group, together with a variable side chain. Just 20 different amino acids\ncontribute to nearly all of the thousands of different proteins important in human structure and function. Body\nproteins contain a unique combination of a few dozen to a few hundred of these 20 amino acid monomers. All 20 of\nthese amino acids share a similar structure (Figure 2.24). All consist of a central carbon atom to which the following\nare bonded:\n•\na hydrogen atom\n•\nan alkaline (basic) amino group NH2 (see Table 2.1)\n•\nan acidic carboxyl group COOH (see Table 2.1)\n•\na variable group\nFIGURE 2.24\nStructure of an Amino Acid\n68\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNotice that all amino acids contain both an acid (the carboxyl group) and a base (the amino group) (amine =\n“nitrogen-containing”). For this reason, they make excellent buffers, helping the body regulate acid–base balance.\nWhat distinguishes the 20 amino acids from one another is their variable group, which is referred to as a side chain\nor an R-group. This group can vary in size and can be polar or nonpolar, giving each amino acid its unique\ncharacteristics. For example, the side chains of two amino acids—cysteine and methionine—contain sulfur. Sulfur\ndoes not readily participate in hydrogen bonds, whereas all other amino acids do. This variation influences the way\nthat proteins containing cysteine and methionine are assembled.\nAmino acids join via dehydration synthesis to form protein polymers (Figure 2.25). The unique bond holding amino\nacids together is called a peptide bond. A peptide bond is a covalent bond between two amino acids that forms by\ndehydration synthesis. A peptide, in fact, is a very short chain of amino acids.', 'Sulfur\ndoes not readily participate in hydrogen bonds, whereas all other amino acids do.

The unique bond holding amino\nacids together is called a peptide bond. A peptide bond is a covalent bond between two amino acids that forms by\ndehydration synthesis. A peptide, in fact, is a very short chain of amino acids. Strands containing fewer than about\n100 amino acids are generally referred to as polypeptides rather than proteins.\nFIGURE 2.25\nPeptide Bond\nDifferent amino acids join together to form peptides, polypeptides, or proteins via dehydration synthesis.\nThe bonds between the amino acids are peptide bonds R1 and R2 may be the same or different side chains.\nThe body is able to synthesize most of the amino acids from components of other molecules; however, nine cannot\nbe synthesized and have to be consumed in the diet. These are known as the essential amino acids.\nFree amino acids available for protein construction are said to reside in the amino acid pool within cells. Structures\nwithin cells use these amino acids when assembling proteins. If a particular essential amino acid is not available in\nsufficient quantities in the amino acid pool, however, synthesis of proteins containing it can slow or even cease.\nShape of Proteins\nJust as a fork cannot be used to eat soup and a spoon cannot be used to spear meat, a protein’s shape is essential\nto its function. A protein’s shape is determined, most fundamentally, by the sequence of amino acids of which it is\nmade (Figure 2.26a).

The most common secondary structure is a spiral called an alpha-helix. If you were to take a length of\nstring and simply twist it into a spiral, it would not hold the shape. Similarly, a strand of amino acids could not\nmaintain a stable spiral shape without the help of hydrogen bonds, which create bridges between different regions\nof the same strand (see Figure 2.26b). Less commonly, a polypeptide chain can form a beta-pleated sheet, in which\nhydrogen bonds form bridges between different regions of a single polypeptide that has folded back upon itself, or\nbetween two or more adjacent polypeptide chains.\nThe secondary structure of proteins further folds into a compact three-dimensional shape, referred to as the\nprotein’s tertiary structure (see Figure 2.26c). In this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the\nprimary chain can be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds.\nA disulfide bond is a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. Often, two or more separate\npolypeptides bond to form an even larger protein with a quaternary structure (see Figure 2.26d). The polypeptide\nsubunits forming a quaternary structure can be identical or different.', 'The four types most important to human structure and function are carbohydrates,\nlipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Before exploring these compounds, you need to first understand the chemistry of\ncarbon.\nThe Chemistry of Carbon\nWhat makes organic compounds ubiquitous is the chemistry of their carbon core. Recall that carbon atoms have four\nelectrons in their valence shell, and that the octet rule dictates that atoms tend to react in such a way as to\ncomplete their valence shell with eight electrons. Carbon atoms do not complete their valence shells by donating or\naccepting four electrons. Instead, they readily share electrons via covalent bonds.\nCommonly, carbon atoms share with other carbon atoms, often forming a long carbon chain referred to as a carbon\nskeleton. When they do share, however, they do not share all their electrons exclusively with each other. Rather,\ncarbon atoms tend to share electrons with a variety of other elements, one of which is always hydrogen. Carbon and\nhydrogen groupings are called hydrocarbons. If you study the figures of organic compounds in the remainder of this\nchapter, you will see several with chains of hydrocarbons in one region of the compound.\nMany combinations are possible to fill carbon’s four “vacancies.” Carbon may share electrons with oxygen or\nnitrogen or other atoms in a particular region of an organic compound. Moreover, the atoms to which carbon atoms\nbond may also be part of a functional group. A functional group is a group of atoms linked by strong covalent bonds\n2.5 • Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n61\nand tending to function in chemical reactions as a single unit. You can think of functional groups as tightly knit\n“cliques” whose members are unlikely to be parted.

Where are the bonds between amino acids located?,"['Sulfur\ndoes not readily participate in hydrogen bonds, whereas all other amino acids do. This variation influences the way\nthat proteins containing cysteine and methionine are assembled.\nAmino acids join via dehydration synthesis to form protein polymers (Figure 2.25). The unique bond holding amino\nacids together is called a peptide bond. A peptide bond is a covalent bond between two amino acids that forms by\ndehydration synthesis. A peptide, in fact, is a very short chain of amino acids. Strands containing fewer than about\n100 amino acids are generally referred to as polypeptides rather than proteins.\nFIGURE 2.25\nPeptide Bond\nDifferent amino acids join together to form peptides, polypeptides, or proteins via dehydration synthesis.\nThe bonds between the amino acids are peptide bonds R1 and R2 may be the same or different side chains.\nThe body is able to synthesize most of the amino acids from components of other molecules; however, nine cannot\nbe synthesized and have to be consumed in the diet. These are known as the essential amino acids.\nFree amino acids available for protein construction are said to reside in the amino acid pool within cells. Structures\nwithin cells use these amino acids when assembling proteins. If a particular essential amino acid is not available in\nsufficient quantities in the amino acid pool, however, synthesis of proteins containing it can slow or even cease.\nShape of Proteins\nJust as a fork cannot be used to eat soup and a spoon cannot be used to spear meat, a protein’s shape is essential\nto its function. A protein’s shape is determined, most fundamentally, by the sequence of amino acids of which it is\nmade (Figure 2.26a). The sequence is called the primary structure of the protein.\n2.5 • Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n69\nFIGURE 2.26\nThe Shape of Proteins\n(a) The primary structure is the sequence of amino acids that make up the polypeptide chain.

An amino acid is a molecule\ncomposed of an amino group and a carboxyl group, together with a variable side chain. Just 20 different amino acids\ncontribute to nearly all of the thousands of different proteins important in human structure and function. Body\nproteins contain a unique combination of a few dozen to a few hundred of these 20 amino acid monomers. All 20 of\nthese amino acids share a similar structure (Figure 2.24). All consist of a central carbon atom to which the following\nare bonded:\n•\na hydrogen atom\n•\nan alkaline (basic) amino group NH2 (see Table 2.1)\n•\nan acidic carboxyl group COOH (see Table 2.1)\n•\na variable group\nFIGURE 2.24\nStructure of an Amino Acid\n68\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nNotice that all amino acids contain both an acid (the carboxyl group) and a base (the amino group) (amine =\n“nitrogen-containing”). For this reason, they make excellent buffers, helping the body regulate acid–base balance.\nWhat distinguishes the 20 amino acids from one another is their variable group, which is referred to as a side chain\nor an R-group. This group can vary in size and can be polar or nonpolar, giving each amino acid its unique\ncharacteristics. For example, the side chains of two amino acids—cysteine and methionine—contain sulfur.

The polypeptide\nsubunits forming a quaternary structure can be identical or different.', ""The electrical activity that derives from the\ninteractions of the charged ions is why they are also called electrolytes.\nCovalent Bonds\nUnlike ionic bonds formed by the attraction between a cation’s positive charge and an anion’s negative charge,\nmolecules formed by a covalent bond share electrons in a mutually stabilizing relationship. Like next-door\nneighbors whose kids hang out first at one home and then at the other, the atoms do not lose or gain electrons\npermanently. Instead, the electrons move back and forth between the elements. Because of the close sharing of\npairs of electrons (one electron from each of two atoms), covalent bonds are stronger than ionic bonds.\nNonpolar Covalent Bonds\nFigure 2.9 shows several common types of covalent bonds. Notice that the two covalently bonded atoms typically\nshare just one or two electron pairs, though larger sharings are possible. The important concept to take from this is\nthat in covalent bonds, electrons in the two atoms' overlapping atomic orbitals are shared to fill the valence shells of\nboth atoms, ultimately stabilizing both of the atoms involved. In a single covalent bond, a single electron pair is\nshared between two atoms, while in a double covalent bond, two pairs of electrons are shared between two atoms.\nThere even are triple covalent bonds, where three electron pairs are shared between two atoms.\nFIGURE 2.9\nCovalent Bonding\nYou can see that the covalent bonds shown in Figure 2.9 are balanced. The sharing of the negative electrons is\nrelatively equal, as is the electrical pull of the positive protons in the nucleus of the atoms involved. This is why\ncovalently bonded molecules that are electrically balanced in this way are described as nonpolar; that is, no region\nof the molecule is either more positive or more negative than any other.\nPolar Covalent Bonds\nGroups of legislators with completely opposite views on a particular issue are often described as “polarized” by\nnews writers. In chemistry, a polar molecule is a molecule that contains regions that have opposite electrical\ncharges. Polar molecules occur when atoms share electrons unequally, in polar covalent bonds.\n2.2 • Chemical Bonds\n49\nThe most familiar example of a polar molecule is water (Figure 2.10)."", 'In this configuration, amino acids that had been very distant in the\nprimary chain can be brought quite close via hydrogen bonds or, in proteins containing cysteine, via disulfide bonds.\nA disulfide bond is a covalent bond between sulfur atoms in a polypeptide. Often, two or more separate\npolypeptides bond to form an even larger protein with a quaternary structure (see Figure 2.26d). The polypeptide\nsubunits forming a quaternary structure can be identical or different. For instance, hemoglobin, the protein found in\nred blood cells is composed of four tertiary polypeptides, two of which are called alpha chains and two of which are\ncalled beta chains.\nWhen they are exposed to extreme heat, acids, bases, and certain other substances, proteins will denature.\nDenaturation is a change in the structure of a molecule through physical or chemical means. Denatured proteins\nlose their functional shape and are no longer able to carry out their jobs. An everyday example of protein\ndenaturation is the curdling of milk when acidic lemon juice is added.\nThe contribution of the shape of a protein to its function can hardly be exaggerated. For example, the long, slender\nshape of protein strands that make up muscle tissue is essential to their ability to contract (shorten) and relax\n(lengthen). As another example, bones contain long threads of a protein called collagen that acts as scaffolding\n70\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nupon which bone minerals are deposited.

What is the primary function of messenger RNA (mRNA) in the cell?,"['For example, the DNA triplet CAC (cytosine, adenine, and cytosine) specifies the\namino acid valine. Therefore, a gene, which is composed of multiple triplets in a unique sequence, provides the code\nto build an entire protein, with multiple amino acids in the proper sequence (Figure 3.25). The mechanism by which\ncells turn the DNA code into a protein product is a two-step process, with an RNA molecule as the intermediate.\nFIGURE 3.25\nThe Genetic Code\nDNA holds all of the genetic information necessary to build a cell’s proteins. The nucleotide sequence\nof a gene is ultimately translated into an amino acid sequence of the gene’s corresponding protein.\nFrom DNA to RNA: Transcription\nDNA is housed within the nucleus, and protein synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm, thus there must be some sort\nof intermediate messenger that leaves the nucleus and manages protein synthesis. This intermediate messenger is\nmessenger RNA (mRNA), a single-stranded nucleic acid that carries a copy of the genetic code for a single gene out\nof the nucleus and into the cytoplasm where it is used to produce proteins.\nThere are several different types of RNA, each having different functions in the cell. The structure of RNA is similar\nto DNA with a few small exceptions. For one thing, unlike DNA, most types of RNA, including mRNA, are single-\nstranded and contain no complementary strand. Second, the ribose sugar in RNA contains an additional oxygen\n3.4 • Protein Synthesis\n103\natom compared with DNA. Finally, instead of the base thymine, RNA contains the base uracil. This means that\nadenine will always pair up with uracil during the protein synthesis process.\nGene expression begins with the process called transcription, which is the synthesis of a strand of mRNA that is\ncomplementary to the gene of interest. This process is called transcription because the mRNA is like a transcript, or\ncopy, of the gene’s DNA code. Transcription begins in a fashion somewhat like DNA replication, in that a region of\nDNA unwinds and the two strands separate, however, only that small portion of the DNA will be split apart. The\ntriplets within the gene on this section of the DNA molecule are used as the template to transcribe the\ncomplementary strand of RNA (Figure 3.26).', 'In the first step,\ntranscription, the DNA code is converted into an RNA\ncode. A molecule of messenger RNA that is\ncomplementary to a specific gene is synthesized in a\nprocess similar to DNA replication. The molecule of\nmRNA provides the code to synthesize a protein.

Next, tRNA molecules shuttle the\nappropriate amino acids to the ribosome, one-by-one,\ncoded by sequential triplet codons on the mRNA, until\nthe protein is fully synthesized. When completed, the\nmRNA detaches from the ribosome, and the protein is\nreleased. Typically, multiple ribosomes attach to a\nsingle mRNA molecule at once such that multiple\nproteins can be manufactured from the mRNA\nconcurrently.\n3 • Chapter Review\n119\n3.5 Cell Growth and Division\nThe life of cell consists of stages that make up the cell\ncycle. After a cell is born, it passes through an\ninterphase before it is ready to replicate itself and\nproduce daughter cells. This interphase includes two\ngap phases (G1 and G2), as well as an S phase, during\nwhich its DNA is replicated in preparation for cell\ndivision. The cell cycle is under precise regulation by\nchemical messengers both inside and outside the cell\nthat provide “stop” and “go” signals for movement\nfrom one phase to the next. Failures of these signals\ncan result in cells that continue to divide\nuncontrollably, which can lead to cancer.\nOnce a cell has completed interphase and is ready for\ncell division, it proceeds through four separate stages\nof mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and\ntelophase). Telophase is followed by the division of the\ncytoplasm (cytokinesis), which generates two daughter\ncells. This process takes place in all normally dividing\ncells of the body except for the germ cells that produce\neggs and sperm.\n3.6 Cellular Differentiation\nOne of the major areas of research in biology is that of\nhow cells specialize to assume their unique structures\nand functions, since all cells essentially originate from\na single fertilized egg. Cell differentiation is the process\nof cells becoming specialized as they body develops.', 'This nuclear envelope is studded with protein-\nlined pores that allow materials to be trafficked into\nand out of the nucleus.

A\nvariety of enzymes are enlisted during DNA replication.\nThese enzymes unwind the DNA molecule, separate\nthe two strands, and assist with the building of\ncomplementary strands along each parent strand. The\noriginal DNA strands serve as templates from which\nthe nucleotide sequence of the new strands are\ndetermined and synthesized. When replication is\ncompleted, two identical DNA molecules exist. Each\none contains one original strand and one newly\nsynthesized complementary strand.\n3.4 Protein Synthesis\nDNA stores the information necessary for instructing\nthe cell to perform all of its functions.

ATP is classified as a high energy compound because the two covalent bonds linking its three\nphosphates store a significant amount of potential energy. In the body, the energy released from these high energy\nbonds helps fuel the body’s activities, from muscle contraction to the transport of substances in and out of cells to\nanabolic chemical reactions.\n2.5 • Organic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n73\nFIGURE 2.30\nStructure of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)\nWhen a phosphate group is cleaved from ATP, the products are adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic\nphosphate (Pi). This hydrolysis reaction can be written:\nRemoval of a second phosphate leaves adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and two phosphate groups. Again, these\nreactions also liberate the energy that had been stored in the phosphate-phosphate bonds. They are reversible, too,\nas when ADP undergoes phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is the addition of a phosphate group to an organic\ncompound, in this case, resulting in ATP. In such cases, the same level of energy that had been released during\nhydrolysis must be reinvested to power dehydration synthesis.\nCells can also transfer a phosphate group from ATP to another organic compound. For example, when glucose first\nenters a cell, a phosphate group is transferred from ATP, forming glucose phosphate (C6H12O6—P) and ADP. Once\nglucose is phosphorylated in this way, it can be stored as glycogen or metabolized for immediate energy.\n74\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nKey Terms\nacid\ncompound that releases hydrogen ions (H+) in\nsolution\nactivation energy\namount of energy greater than the\nenergy contained in the reactants,', 'Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a ribose-containing nucleotide that helps manifest the genetic\ncode as protein.

The\ntriplets within the gene on this section of the DNA molecule are used as the template to transcribe the\ncomplementary strand of RNA (Figure 3.26).', 'This refers to the fact\nthat DNA contains the information necessary for the cell to build one very important type of molecule: the protein.\nMost structural components of the cell are made up, at least in part, by proteins and virtually all the functions that a\ncell carries out are completed with the help of proteins. One of the most important classes of proteins is enzymes,\nwhich help speed up necessary biochemical reactions that take place inside the cell. Some of these critical\nbiochemical reactions include building larger molecules from smaller components (such as occurs during DNA\nreplication or synthesis of microtubules) and breaking down larger molecules into smaller components (such as\nwhen harvesting chemical energy from nutrient molecules). Whatever the cellular process may be, it is almost sure\nto involve proteins. Just as the cell’s genome describes its full complement of DNA, a cell’s proteome is its full\ncomplement of proteins. Protein synthesis begins with genes. A gene is a functional segment of DNA that provides\nthe genetic information necessary to build a protein. Each particular gene provides the code necessary to construct\na particular protein. Gene expression, which transforms the information coded in a gene to a final gene product,\nultimately dictates the structure and function of a cell by determining which proteins are made.\nThe interpretation of genes works in the following way. Recall that proteins are polymers, or chains, of many amino\nacid building blocks. The sequence of bases in a gene (that is, its sequence of A, T, C, G nucleotides) translates to an\namino acid sequence. A triplet is a section of three DNA bases in a row that codes for a specific amino acid. Similar\nto the way in which the three-letter code d-o-g signals the image of a dog, the three-letter DNA base code signals\nthe use of a particular amino acid. For example, the DNA triplet CAC (cytosine, adenine, and cytosine) specifies the\namino acid valine. Therefore, a gene, which is composed of multiple triplets in a unique sequence, provides the code\nto build an entire protein, with multiple amino acids in the proper sequence (Figure 3.25). The mechanism by which\ncells turn the DNA code into a protein product is a two-step process, with an RNA molecule as the intermediate.', 'Each new DNA molecule contains one strand from the original molecule and one newly synthesized strand. The term\nfor this mode of replication is “semiconservative,” because half of the original DNA molecule is conserved in each\nnew DNA molecule. This process continues until the cell’s entire genome, the entire complement of an organism’s\nDNA, is replicated. As you might imagine, it is very important that DNA replication take place precisely so that new\ncells in the body contain the exact same genetic material as their parent cells. Mistakes made during DNA\nreplication, such as the accidental addition of an inappropriate nucleotide, have the potential to render a gene\ndysfunctional or useless. Fortunately, there are mechanisms in place to minimize such mistakes. A DNA\nproofreading process enlists the help of special enzymes that scan the newly synthesized molecule for mistakes and\ncorrects them. Once the process of DNA replication is complete, the cell is ready to divide. You will explore the\nprocess of cell division later in the chapter.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/DNArep) to learn about DNA replication.

What is the pH range of blood in a healthy adult?,"['The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH. For instance, a pH value of 4 corresponds to a proton concentration\nof 10–4 M, or 0.0001M, while a pH value of 5 corresponds to a proton concentration of 10–5 M, or 0.00001M. The\nhigher the number above 7, the more basic (alkaline) the solution, or the lower the concentration of H+. Human\nurine, for example, is ten times more acidic than pure water, and HCl is 10,000,000 times more acidic than water.\n2.4 • Inorganic Compounds Essential to Human Functioning\n59\nFIGURE 2.17\nThe pH Scale\nBuffers\nThe pH of human blood normally ranges from 7.35 to 7.45, although it is typically identified as pH 7.4. At this\nslightly basic pH, blood can reduce the acidity resulting from the carbon dioxide (CO2) constantly being released into\nthe bloodstream by the trillions of cells in the body. Homeostatic mechanisms (along with exhaling CO2 while\nbreathing) normally keep the pH of blood within this narrow range. This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4. The body\ntherefore has several mechanisms for this regulation, involving breathing, the excretion of chemicals in urine, and\nthe internal release of chemicals collectively called buffers into body fluids. A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids.', 'These\ncompounds are inorganic; that is, they do not contain\nboth hydrogen and carbon. Water is a lubricant and\ncushion, a heat sink, a component of liquid mixtures, a\nbyproduct of dehydration synthesis reactions, and a\nreactant in hydrolysis reactions. Salts are compounds\nthat, when dissolved in water, dissociate into ions other\nthan H+ or OH–. In contrast, acids release H+ in\nsolution, making it more acidic. Bases accept H+,\nthereby making the solution more alkaline (caustic).\nThe pH of any solution is its relative concentration of\nH+. A solution with pH 7 is neutral. Solutions with pH\nbelow 7 are acids, and solutions with pH above 7 are\nbases. A change in a single digit on the pH scale (e.g.,\nfrom 7 to 8) represents a ten-fold increase or decrease\nin the concentration of H+. In a healthy adult, the pH of\nblood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45. Homeostatic control\nmechanisms important for keeping blood in a healthy\npH range include chemicals called buffers, weak acids\nand weak bases released when the pH of blood or\nother body fluids fluctuates in either direction outside\nof this normal range.\n2.5 Organic Compounds Essential to Human\nFunctioning\nOrganic compounds essential to human functioning\ninclude carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and\nnucleotides. These compounds are said to be organic\nbecause they contain both carbon and hydrogen.\nCarbon atoms in organic compounds readily share\nelectrons with hydrogen and other atoms, usually\noxygen, and sometimes nitrogen. Carbon atoms also\nmay bond with one or more functional groups such as\ncarboxyls, hydroxyls, aminos, or phosphates.\nMonomers are single units of organic compounds. They\nbond by dehydration synthesis to form polymers, which\ncan in turn be broken by hydrolysis.\nCarbohydrate compounds provide essential body fuel.\nTheir structural forms include monosaccharides such\nas glucose, disaccharides such as lactose, and\npolysaccharides, including starches (polymers of\nglucose), glycogen (the storage form of glucose), and\nfiber. All body cells can use glucose for fuel.', '(b) In aqueous solution, a base dissociates into hydroxyl ions (OH–) and\ncations. Nearly every molecule of a strong base dissociates, producing a high concentration of OH–.\nBases\nA base is a substance that releases hydroxyl ions (OH–) in solution, or one that accepts H+ already present in\nsolution (see Figure 2.16b). The hydroxyl ions (also known as hydroxide ions) or other basic substances combine\nwith H+ present to form a water molecule, thereby removing H+ and reducing the solution’s acidity. Strong bases\nrelease most or all of their hydroxyl ions; weak bases release only some hydroxyl ions or absorb only a few H+. Food\nmixed with hydrochloric acid from the stomach would burn the small intestine, the next portion of the digestive tract\nafter the stomach, if it were not for the release of bicarbonate (HCO3–), a weak base that attracts H+. Bicarbonate\naccepts some of the H+ protons, thereby reducing the acidity of the solution.\nThe Concept of pH\nThe relative acidity or alkalinity of a solution can be indicated by its pH. A solution’s pH is the negative, base-10\nlogarithm of the hydrogen ion (H+) concentration of the solution. As an example, a pH 4 solution has an H+\nconcentration that is ten times greater than that of a pH 5 solution. That is, a solution with a pH of 4 is ten times\nmore acidic than a solution with a pH of 5. The concept of pH will begin to make more sense when you study the pH\nscale, like that shown in Figure 2.17. The scale consists of a series of increments ranging from 0 to 14. A solution\nwith a pH of 7 is considered neutral—neither acidic nor basic. Pure water has a pH of 7. The lower the number below\n7, the more acidic the solution, or the greater the concentration of H+. The concentration of hydrogen ions at each\npH value is 10 times different than the next pH.', 'Immediate treatment is with\npure oxygen. The affected person is then moved into a hyperbaric chamber. A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,\nclosed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body\nso that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to\nthe body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing\nsome of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.\nThe dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the\npressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body\ntissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the\npulsating flow of pressurized blood.\n1.5 Homeostasis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning\n•\nContrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism\nMaintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body\ntemperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point.\nA set point is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set\nof values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is\napproximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to\nfluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a).', 'This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4.

A buffer is a solution of a weak acid and\nits conjugate base. A buffer can neutralize small amounts of acids or bases in body fluids. For example, if there is\neven a slight decrease below 7.35 in the pH of a bodily fluid, the buffer in the fluid—in this case, acting as a weak\nbase—will bind the excess hydrogen ions. In contrast, if pH rises above 7.45, the buffer will act as a weak acid and\ncontribute hydrogen ions.\n60\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nHOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCES\nAcids and Bases\nExcessive acidity of the blood and other body fluids is known as acidosis. Common causes of acidosis are situations\nand disorders that reduce the effectiveness of breathing, especially the person’s ability to exhale fully, which causes\na buildup of CO2 (and H+) in the bloodstream. Acidosis can also be caused by metabolic problems that reduce the\nlevel or function of buffers that act as bases, or that promote the production of acids. For instance, with severe\ndiarrhea, too much bicarbonate can be lost from the body, allowing acids to build up in body fluids. In people with\npoorly managed diabetes (ineffective regulation of blood sugar), acids called ketones are produced as a form of\nbody fuel. These can build up in the blood, causing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Kidney failure,\nliver failure, heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.\nIn contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic). As with\nacidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low.\nLung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the\nnormal concentration of H+.']","The pH range of blood in a healthy adult is typically between 7.35 and 7.45, with an average of approximately 7.4.",The pH of blood ranges from 7.35 to 7.45.

Carbon atoms do not complete their valence shells by donating or\naccepting four electrons.

If you study the figures of organic compounds in the remainder of this\nchapter, you will see several with chains of hydrocarbons in one region of the compound.\nMany combinations are possible to fill carbon’s four “vacancies.” Carbon may share electrons with oxygen or\nnitrogen or other atoms in a particular region of an organic compound.

Organic compounds are covered later in the chapter.\nWater\nAs much as 70 percent of an adult’s body weight is water. This water is contained both within the cells and between\nthe cells that make up tissues and organs. Its several roles make water indispensable to human functioning.\nWater as a Lubricant and Cushion\nWater is a major component of many of the body’s lubricating fluids. Just as oil lubricates the hinge on a door, water\nin synovial fluid lubricates the actions of body joints, and water in pleural fluid helps the lungs expand and recoil\nwith breathing. Watery fluids help keep food flowing through the digestive tract, and ensure that the movement of\nadjacent abdominal organs is friction free.\nWater also protects cells and organs from physical trauma, cushioning the brain within the skull, for example, and\nprotecting the delicate nerve tissue of the eyes. Water cushions a developing fetus in the mother’s womb as well.\nWater as a Heat Sink\nA heat sink is a substance or object that absorbs and dissipates heat but does not experience a corresponding\nincrease in temperature. In the body, water absorbs the heat generated by chemical reactions without greatly\nincreasing in temperature. Moreover, when the environmental temperature soars, the water stored in the body helps\nkeep the body cool. This cooling effect happens as warm blood from the body’s core flows to the blood vessels just\nunder the skin and is transferred to the environment. At the same time, sweat glands release warm water in sweat.\nAs the water evaporates into the air, it carries away heat, and then the cooler blood from the periphery circulates\nback to the body core.', 'These can build up in the blood, causing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Kidney failure,\nliver failure, heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.\nIn contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic). As with\nacidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low.\nLung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the\nnormal concentration of H+.\nMetabolic alkalosis often results from prolonged, severe vomiting, which causes a loss of hydrogen and chloride ions\n(as components of HCl). Medications also can prompt alkalosis.

What is homeostasis?,"['Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a). A sensor, also referred to a receptor, is a\ncomponent of a feedback system that monitors a physiological value. This value is reported to the control center.\nThe control center is the component in a feedback system that compares the value to the normal range. If the value\ndeviates too much from the set point, then the control center activates an effector. An effector is the component in\na feedback system that causes a change to reverse the situation and return the value to the normal range.\n20\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 1.10\nNegative Feedback System\nIn a negative feedback system, a stimulus—a deviation from a set point—is resisted through\na physiological process that returns the body to homeostasis. (a) A negative feedback system has five basic parts. (b) Body temperature is\nregulated by negative feedback.\nIn order to set the system in motion, a stimulus must drive a physiological parameter beyond its normal range (that\nis, beyond homeostasis). This stimulus is “heard” by a specific sensor. For example, in the control of blood glucose,\nspecific endocrine cells in the pancreas detect excess glucose (the stimulus) in the bloodstream. These pancreatic\nbeta cells respond to the increased level of blood glucose by releasing the hormone insulin into the bloodstream.\nThe insulin signals skeletal muscle fibers, fat cells (adipocytes), and liver cells to take up the excess glucose,\nremoving it from the bloodstream. As glucose concentration in the bloodstream drops, the decrease in\nconcentration—the actual negative feedback—is detected by pancreatic alpha cells, and insulin release stops. This\nprevents blood sugar levels from continuing to drop below the normal range.\nHumans have a similar temperature regulation feedback system that works by promoting either heat loss or heat\ngain (Figure 1.10b).', 'The insulin signals skeletal muscle fibers, fat cells (adipocytes), and liver cells to take up the excess glucose,\nremoving it from the bloodstream.

When the brain’s temperature regulation center receives data from the sensors indicating that\nthe body’s temperature exceeds its normal range, it stimulates a cluster of brain cells referred to as the “heat-loss\ncenter.” This stimulation has three major effects:\n•\nBlood vessels in the skin begin to dilate allowing more blood from the body core to flow to the surface of the\nskin allowing the heat to radiate into the environment.\n•\nAs blood flow to the skin increases, sweat glands are activated to increase their output. As the sweat\nevaporates from the skin surface into the surrounding air, it takes heat with it.\n•\nThe depth of respiration increases, and a person may breathe through an open mouth instead of through the\nnasal passageways. This further increases heat loss from the lungs.\nIn contrast, activation of the brain’s heat-gain center by exposure to cold reduces blood flow to the skin, and blood\nreturning from the limbs is diverted into a network of deep veins. This arrangement traps heat closer to the body\ncore and restricts heat loss. If heat loss is severe, the brain triggers an increase in random signals to skeletal\nmuscles, causing them to contract and producing shivering. The muscle contractions of shivering release heat while\nusing up ATP. The brain triggers the thyroid gland in the endocrine system to release thyroid hormone, which\nincreases metabolic activity and heat production in cells throughout the body. The brain also signals the adrenal\nglands to release epinephrine (adrenaline), a hormone that causes the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which\ncan be used as an energy source. The breakdown of glycogen into glucose also results in increased metabolism and\nheat production.\n1.5 • Homeostasis\n21\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nWater concentration in the body is critical for proper functioning.', 'This is critical, because fluctuations—either too\nacidic or too alkaline—can lead to life-threatening disorders.\nAll cells of the body depend on homeostatic regulation of acid–base balance at a pH of approximately 7.4.

In contrast, if pH rises above 7.45, the buffer will act as a weak acid and\ncontribute hydrogen ions.\n60\n2 • The Chemical Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nHOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCES\nAcids and Bases\nExcessive acidity of the blood and other body fluids is known as acidosis. Common causes of acidosis are situations\nand disorders that reduce the effectiveness of breathing, especially the person’s ability to exhale fully, which causes\na buildup of CO2 (and H+) in the bloodstream. Acidosis can also be caused by metabolic problems that reduce the\nlevel or function of buffers that act as bases, or that promote the production of acids. For instance, with severe\ndiarrhea, too much bicarbonate can be lost from the body, allowing acids to build up in body fluids. In people with\npoorly managed diabetes (ineffective regulation of blood sugar), acids called ketones are produced as a form of\nbody fuel. These can build up in the blood, causing a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. Kidney failure,\nliver failure, heart failure, cancer, and other disorders also can prompt metabolic acidosis.\nIn contrast, alkalosis is a condition in which the blood and other body fluids are too alkaline (basic). As with\nacidosis, respiratory disorders are a major cause; however, in respiratory alkalosis, carbon dioxide levels fall too low.\nLung disease, aspirin overdose, shock, and ordinary anxiety can cause respiratory alkalosis, which reduces the\nnormal concentration of H+.', 'Immediate treatment is with\npure oxygen. The affected person is then moved into a hyperbaric chamber. A hyperbaric chamber is a reinforced,\nclosed chamber that is pressurized to greater than atmospheric pressure. It treats DCS by repressurizing the body\nso that pressure can then be removed much more gradually. Because the hyperbaric chamber introduces oxygen to\nthe body at high pressure, it increases the concentration of oxygen in the blood. This has the effect of replacing\nsome of the nitrogen in the blood with oxygen, which is easier to tolerate out of solution.\nThe dynamic pressure of body fluids is also important to human survival. For example, blood pressure, which is the\npressure exerted by blood as it flows within blood vessels, must be great enough to enable blood to reach all body\ntissues, and yet low enough to ensure that the delicate blood vessels can withstand the friction and force of the\npulsating flow of pressurized blood.\n1.5 Homeostasis\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDiscuss the role of homeostasis in healthy functioning\n•\nContrast negative and positive feedback, giving one physiologic example of each mechanism\nMaintaining homeostasis requires that the body continuously monitor its internal conditions. From body\ntemperature to blood pressure to levels of certain nutrients, each physiological condition has a particular set point.\nA set point is the physiological value around which the normal range fluctuates. A normal range is the restricted set\nof values that is optimally healthful and stable. For example, the set point for normal human body temperature is\napproximately 37°C (98.6°F) Physiological parameters, such as body temperature and blood pressure, tend to\nfluctuate within a normal range a few degrees above and below that point. Control centers in the brain and other\nparts of the body monitor and react to deviations from homeostasis using negative feedback. Negative feedback is\na mechanism that reverses a deviation from the set point. Therefore, negative feedback maintains body parameters\nwithin their normal range. The maintenance of homeostasis by negative feedback goes on throughout the body at all\ntimes, and an understanding of negative feedback is thus fundamental to an understanding of human physiology.\nNegative Feedback\nA negative feedback system has three basic components (Figure 1.10a).', 'The brain triggers the thyroid gland in the endocrine system to release thyroid hormone, which\nincreases metabolic activity and heat production in cells throughout the body. The brain also signals the adrenal\nglands to release epinephrine (adrenaline), a hormone that causes the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which\ncan be used as an energy source. The breakdown of glycogen into glucose also results in increased metabolism and\nheat production.\n1.5 • Homeostasis\n21\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nWater concentration in the body is critical for proper functioning. A person’s body retains very tight control on water\nlevels without conscious control by the person. Watch this video (http://openstax.org/l/H2Ocon) to learn more about\nwater concentration in the body. Which organ has primary control over the amount of water in the body?\nPositive Feedback\nPositive feedback intensifies a change in the body’s physiological condition rather than reversing it. A deviation\nfrom the normal range results in more change, and the system moves farther away from the normal range. Positive\nfeedback in the body is normal only when there is a definite end point. Childbirth and the body’s response to blood\nloss are two examples of positive feedback loops that are normal but are activated only when needed.\nChildbirth at full term is an example of a situation in which the maintenance of the existing body state is not desired.\nEnormous changes in a person’s body are required to expel the baby at the end of pregnancy. And the events of\nchildbirth, once begun, must progress rapidly to a conclusion or the life of a person giving bith and the baby are at\nrisk. The extreme muscular work of labor and delivery are the result of a positive feedback system (Figure 1.11).\nFIGURE 1.11\nPositive Feedback Loop\nNormal childbirth is driven by a positive feedback loop. A positive feedback loop results in a\nchange in the body’s status, rather than a return to homeostasis.\nThe first contractions of labor (the stimulus) push the baby toward the cervix (the lowest part of the uterus). The\ncervix contains stretch-sensitive nerve cells that monitor the degree of stretching (the sensors). These nerve cells\nsend messages to the brain, which in turn causes the pituitary gland at the base of the brain to release the hormone\noxytocin into the bloodstream.']","Homeostasis is the body's ability to maintain stable internal conditions, such as temperature and pH, within a normal range despite external changes. It involves continuous monitoring and regulation through mechanisms like negative feedback, which reverses deviations from set points to ensure optimal physiological functioning.",Homeostasis is a dynamic state of balance within parameters that are compatible with life.

It is composed of a\nphospholipid bilayer, with hydrophobic internal lipid\n“tails” and hydrophilic external phosphate “heads.”\nVarious membrane proteins are scattered throughout\nthe bilayer, both inserted within it and attached to it\nperipherally. The cell membrane is selectively\npermeable, allowing only a limited number of materials\nto diffuse through its lipid bilayer. All materials that\ncross the membrane do so using passive (non energy-\nrequiring) or active (energy-requiring) transport\nprocesses. During passive transport, materials move by\nsimple diffusion or by facilitated diffusion through the\nmembrane, down their concentration gradient. Water\n118\n3 • Chapter Review\nAccess for free at openstax.org\npasses through the membrane in a diffusion process\ncalled osmosis. During active transport, energy is\nexpended to assist material movement across the\nmembrane in a direction against their concentration\ngradient. Active transport may take place with the help\nof protein pumps or through the use of vesicles.\n3.2 The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles\nThe internal environmental of a living cell is made up of\na fluid, jelly-like substance called cytosol, which\nconsists mainly of water, but also contains various\ndissolved nutrients and other molecules. The cell\ncontains an array of cellular organelles, each one\nperforming a unique function and helping to maintain\nthe health and activity of the cell. The cytosol and\norganelles together compose the cell’s cytoplasm.\nMost organelles are surrounded by a lipid membrane\nsimilar to the cell membrane of the cell. The\nendoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and\nlysosomes share a functional connectivity and are\ncollectively referred to as the endomembrane system.\nThere are two types of ER: smooth and rough. While\nthe smooth ER performs many functions, including lipid\nsynthesis and ion storage, the rough ER is mainly\nresponsible for protein synthesis using its associated\nribosomes. The rough ER sends newly made proteins\nto the Golgi apparatus where they are modified and\npackaged for delivery to various locations within or\noutside of the cell.', 'As the outer layer of your skin separates your body from its environment, the cell membrane (also\nknown as the plasma membrane) separates the inner contents of a cell from its exterior environment. This cell\nmembrane provides a protective barrier around the cell and regulates which materials can pass in or out.\nStructure and Composition of the Cell Membrane\nThe cell membrane is an extremely pliable structure composed primarily of back-to-back phospholipids (a\n“bilayer”). Cholesterol is also present, which contributes to the fluidity of the membrane, and there are various\nproteins embedded within the membrane that have a variety of functions.\nA single phospholipid molecule has a phosphate group on one end, called the “head,” and two side-by-side chains\nof fatty acids that make up the lipid tails (Figure 3.2). The phosphate group is negatively charged, making the head\npolar and hydrophilic—or “water loving.” A hydrophilic molecule (or region of a molecule) is one that is attracted to\nwater. The phosphate heads are thus attracted to the water molecules of both the extracellular and intracellular\nenvironments. The lipid tails, on the other hand, are uncharged, or nonpolar, and are hydrophobic—or “water\nfearing.” A hydrophobic molecule (or region of a molecule) repels and is repelled by water. Some lipid tails consist\nof saturated fatty acids and some contain unsaturated fatty acids. This combination adds to the fluidity of the tails\nthat are constantly in motion. Phospholipids are thus amphipathic molecules. An amphipathic molecule is one that\ncontains both a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic region. In fact, soap works to remove oil and grease stains because it\nhas amphipathic properties. The hydrophilic portion can dissolve in water while the hydrophobic portion can trap\ngrease in micelles that then can be washed away.\n82\n3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 3.2\nPhospholipid Structure\nA phospholipid molecule consists of a polar phosphate “head,” which is hydrophilic and a non-\npolar lipid “tail,” which is hydrophobic.

What is simple diffusion?,"['O2 generally diffuses into cells because it is more concentrated outside of them, and CO2 typically\ndiffuses out of cells because it is more concentrated inside of them. Neither of these examples requires any energy\non the part of the cell, and therefore they use passive transport to move across the membrane.\nBefore moving on, you need to review the gases that can diffuse across a cell membrane. Because cells rapidly use\nup oxygen during metabolism, there is typically a lower concentration of O2 inside the cell than outside. As a result,\noxygen will diffuse from the interstitial fluid directly through the lipid bilayer of the membrane and into the\ncytoplasm within the cell. On the other hand, because cells produce CO2 as a byproduct of metabolism, CO2\nconcentrations rise within the cytoplasm; therefore, CO2 will move from the cell through the lipid bilayer and into the\ninterstitial fluid, where its concentration is lower. This mechanism of molecules moving across a cell membrane\nfrom the side where they are more concentrated to the side where they are less concentrated is a form of passive\ntransport called simple diffusion (Figure 3.5).\nFIGURE 3.5\nSimple Diffusion across the Cell (Plasma) Membrane\nThe structure of the lipid bilayer allows small, uncharged\nsubstances such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, and hydrophobic molecules such as lipids, to pass through the cell membrane, down their\nconcentration gradient, by simple diffusion.\nLarge polar or ionic molecules, which are hydrophilic, cannot easily cross the phospholipid bilayer. Very small polar\nmolecules, such as water, can cross via simple diffusion due to their small size. Charged atoms or molecules of any\nsize cannot cross the cell membrane via simple diffusion as the charges are repelled by the hydrophobic tails in the\ninterior of the phospholipid bilayer. Solutes dissolved in water on either side of the cell membrane will tend to\n3.1 • The Cell Membrane\n85\ndiffuse down their concentration gradients, but because most substances cannot pass freely through the lipid\nbilayer of the cell membrane, their movement is restricted to protein channels and specialized transport\nmechanisms in the membrane.', 'Charged atoms or molecules of any\nsize cannot cross the cell membrane via simple diffusion as the charges are repelled by the hydrophobic tails in the\ninterior of the phospholipid bilayer.

Facilitated diffusion is the diffusion process used for those substances that cannot\ncross the lipid bilayer due to their size, charge, and/or polarity (Figure 3.6). A common example of facilitated\ndiffusion is the movement of glucose into the cell, where it is used to make ATP. Although glucose can be more\nconcentrated outside of a cell, it cannot cross the lipid bilayer via simple diffusion because it is both large and polar.\nTo resolve this, a specialized carrier protein called the glucose transporter will transfer glucose molecules into the\ncell to facilitate its inward diffusion.\nFIGURE 3.6\nFacilitated Diffusion\n(a) Facilitated diffusion of substances crossing the cell (plasma) membrane takes place with the help\nof proteins such as channel proteins and carrier proteins. Channel proteins are less selective than carrier proteins, and usually mildly\ndiscriminate between their cargo based on size and charge. (b) Carrier proteins are more selective, often only allowing one particular type\nof molecule to cross.\nAs an example, even though sodium ions (Na+) are highly concentrated outside of cells, these electrolytes are\ncharged and cannot pass through the nonpolar lipid bilayer of the membrane. Their diffusion is facilitated by\nmembrane proteins that form sodium channels (or “pores”), so that Na+ ions can move down their concentration\ngradient from outside the cells to inside the cells. There are many other solutes that must undergo facilitated\ndiffusion to move into a cell, such as amino acids, or to move out of a cell, such as wastes. Because facilitated\ndiffusion is a passive process, it does not require energy expenditure by the cell.\nWater also can move freely across the cell membrane of all cells, either through protein channels or by slipping\nbetween the lipid tails of the membrane itself.', 'Transitional describes a form of specialized\nstratified epithelium in which the shape of the cells can vary.\nFIGURE 4.6\nCells of Epithelial Tissue\nSimple epithelial tissue is organized as a single layer of cells and stratified epithelial tissue is\nformed by several layers of cells.\nSimple Epithelium\nThe shape of the cells in the single cell layer of simple epithelium reflects the functioning of those cells.

O2 generally diffuses into cells because it is more concentrated outside of them, and CO2 typically\ndiffuses out of cells because it is more concentrated inside of them. Neither of these examples requires any energy\non the part of the cell, and therefore they use passive transport to move across the membrane.\nBefore moving on, you need to review the gases that can diffuse across a cell membrane. Because cells rapidly use\nup oxygen during metabolism, there is typically a lower concentration of O2 inside the cell than outside.', '1 The Cell Membrane\nThe cell membrane provides a barrier around the cell,\nseparating its internal components from the\nextracellular environment. It is composed of a\nphospholipid bilayer, with hydrophobic internal lipid\n“tails” and hydrophilic external phosphate “heads.”\nVarious membrane proteins are scattered throughout\nthe bilayer, both inserted within it and attached to it\nperipherally. The cell membrane is selectively\npermeable, allowing only a limited number of materials\nto diffuse through its lipid bilayer. All materials that\ncross the membrane do so using passive (non energy-\nrequiring) or active (energy-requiring) transport\nprocesses.

The cell\ncontains an array of cellular organelles, each one\nperforming a unique function and helping to maintain\nthe health and activity of the cell. The cytosol and\norganelles together compose the cell’s cytoplasm.\nMost organelles are surrounded by a lipid membrane\nsimilar to the cell membrane of the cell.

Facilitated diffusion is the diffusion process used for those substances that cannot\ncross the lipid bilayer due to their size, charge, and/or polarity (Figure 3.6). A common example of facilitated\ndiffusion is the movement of glucose into the cell, where it is used to make ATP. Although glucose can be more\nconcentrated outside of a cell, it cannot cross the lipid bilayer via simple diffusion because it is both large and polar.\nTo resolve this, a specialized carrier protein called the glucose transporter will transfer glucose molecules into the\ncell to facilitate its inward diffusion.\nFIGURE 3.6\nFacilitated Diffusion\n(a) Facilitated diffusion of substances crossing the cell (plasma) membrane takes place with the help\nof proteins such as channel proteins and carrier proteins. Channel proteins are less selective than carrier proteins, and usually mildly\ndiscriminate between their cargo based on size and charge. (b) Carrier proteins are more selective, often only allowing one particular type\nof molecule to cross.\nAs an example, even though sodium ions (Na+) are highly concentrated outside of cells, these electrolytes are\ncharged and cannot pass through the nonpolar lipid bilayer of the membrane. Their diffusion is facilitated by\nmembrane proteins that form sodium channels (or “pores”), so that Na+ ions can move down their concentration\ngradient from outside the cells to inside the cells. There are many other solutes that must undergo facilitated\ndiffusion to move into a cell, such as amino acids, or to move out of a cell, such as wastes. Because facilitated\ndiffusion is a passive process, it does not require energy expenditure by the cell.\nWater also can move freely across the cell membrane of all cells, either through protein channels or by slipping\nbetween the lipid tails of the membrane itself.']","Oxygen (O2) diffuses into the cell through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane from the interstitial fluid, where it is more concentrated, while carbon dioxide (CO2) diffuses out of the cell into the interstitial fluid, where its concentration is lower.

What is the process of a cell exporting material using vesicular transport?,"['FIGURE 3.10\nThree Forms of Endocytosis\nEndocytosis is a form of active transport in which a cell envelopes extracellular materials\nusing its cell membrane. (a) In phagocytosis, which is relatively nonselective, the cell takes in a large particle. (b) In pinocytosis, the cell\ntakes in small particles in fluid. (c) In contrast, receptor-mediated endocytosis is quite selective. When external receptors bind a specific\nligand, the cell responds by endocytosing the ligand.\nPhagocytosis and pinocytosis take in large portions of extracellular material, and they are typically not highly\nselective in the substances they bring in. Cells regulate the endocytosis of specific substances via receptor-\nmediated endocytosis. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is endocytosis by a portion of the cell membrane that\ncontains many receptors that are specific for a certain substance. Once the surface receptors have bound sufficient\namounts of the specific substance (the receptor’s ligand), the cell will endocytose the part of the cell membrane\ncontaining the receptor-ligand complexes. Iron, a required component of hemoglobin, is endocytosed by red blood\ncells in this way. Iron is bound to a protein called transferrin in the blood. Specific transferrin receptors on red blood\ncell surfaces bind the iron-transferrin molecules, and the cell endocytoses the receptor-ligand complexes.\nIn contrast with endocytosis, exocytosis (taking “out of the cell”) is the process of a cell exporting material using\nvesicular transport (Figure 3.11). Many cells manufacture substances that must be secreted, like a factory\nmanufacturing a product for export. These substances are typically packaged into membrane-bound vesicles within\nthe cell. When the vesicle membrane fuses with the cell membrane, the vesicle releases it contents into the\ninterstitial fluid. The vesicle membrane then becomes part of the cell membrane. Cells of the stomach and pancreas\nproduce and secrete digestive enzymes through exocytosis (Figure 3.12).', ""The flood of\nsodium ions through the symporter provides the energy that allows glucose to move through the symporter and into\nthe cell, against its concentration gradient.\nConversely, antiporters are secondary active transport systems that transport substances in opposite directions. For\nexample, the sodium-hydrogen ion antiporter uses the energy from the inward flood of sodium ions to move\nhydrogen ions (H+) out of the cell. The sodium-hydrogen antiporter is used to maintain the pH of the cell's interior.\nOther forms of active transport do not involve membrane carriers. Endocytosis (bringing “into the cell”) is the\nprocess of a cell ingesting material by enveloping it in a portion of its cell membrane, and then pinching off that\nportion of membrane (Figure 3.10). Once pinched off, the portion of membrane and its contents becomes an\nindependent, intracellular vesicle. A vesicle is a membranous sac—a spherical and hollow organelle bounded by a\nlipid bilayer membrane. Endocytosis often brings materials into the cell that must be broken down or digested.\n88\n3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nPhagocytosis (“cell eating”) is the endocytosis of large particles.

The accumulation of both Cl– and Na+ ions in the extracellular space creates\nsolute-rich mucus, which has a low concentration of water molecules. As a result, through osmosis, water\nmoves from cells and extracellular matrix into the mucus, “thinning” it out. This is how, in a normal respiratory\nsystem, the mucus is kept sufficiently watered-down to be propelled out of the respiratory system.\nIf the CFTR channel is absent, Cl– ions are not transported out of the cell in adequate numbers, thus preventing\nthem from drawing positive ions. The absence of ions in the secreted mucus results in the lack of a normal water\nconcentration gradient. Thus, there is no osmotic pressure pulling water into the mucus. The resulting mucus is\nthick and sticky, and the ciliated epithelia cannot effectively remove it from the respiratory system. Passageways\nin the lungs become blocked with mucus, along with the debris it carries. Bacterial infections occur more easily\nbecause bacterial cells are not effectively carried away from the lungs.\n3.2 • The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles\n91\nFIGURE 3.13\nPrototypical Human Cell\nWhile this image is not indicative of any one particular human cell, it is a prototypical example\nof a cell containing the primary organelles and internal structures.\nOrganelles of the Endomembrane System\nA set of three major organelles together form a system within the cell called the endomembrane system. These\norganelles work together to perform various cellular jobs, including the task of producing, packaging, and exporting\ncertain cellular products. The organelles of the endomembrane system include the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi\napparatus, and vesicles.\nEndoplasmic Reticulum\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a system of channels that is continuous with the nuclear membrane (or\n“envelope”) covering the nucleus and composed of the same lipid bilayer material.

Biochemical reactions within\nmitochondria transform energy-carrying molecules into\nthe usable form of cellular energy known as ATP.\nPeroxisomes contain enzymes that transform harmful\nsubstances such as free radicals into oxygen and water.\nCells also contain a miniaturized “skeleton” of protein\nfilaments that extend throughout its interior. Three\ndifferent kinds of filaments compose this cytoskeleton\n(in order of increasing thickness): microfilaments,\nintermediate filaments, and microtubules. Each\ncytoskeletal component performs unique functions as\nwell as provides a supportive framework for the cell.\n3.3 The Nucleus and DNA Replication\nThe nucleus is the command center of the cell,\ncontaining the genetic instructions for all of the\nmaterials a cell will make (and thus all of its functions it\ncan perform). The nucleus is encased within a\nmembrane of two interconnected lipid bilayers, side-\nby-side. This nuclear envelope is studded with protein-\nlined pores that allow materials to be trafficked into\nand out of the nucleus. The nucleus contains one or\nmore nucleoli, which serve as sites for ribosome\nsynthesis. The nucleus houses the genetic material of\nthe cell: DNA. DNA is normally found as a loosely\ncontained structure called chromatin within the\nnucleus, where it is wound up and associated with a\nvariety of histone proteins. When a cell is about to\ndivide, the chromatin coils tightly and condenses to\nform chromosomes.']","The process of a cell exporting material using vesicular transport is called exocytosis.

Just\nas you must consume nutrients to provide yourself with energy, so must each of your cells take in nutrients, some of\nwhich convert to chemical energy that can be used to power biochemical reactions. Another important function of\nthe cell is detoxification. Humans take in all sorts of toxins from the environment and also produce harmful\nchemicals as byproducts of cellular processes. Cells called hepatocytes in the liver detoxify many of these toxins.\nMitochondria\nA mitochondrion (plural = mitochondria) is a membranous, bean-shaped organelle that is the “energy transformer”\nof the cell.', 'Free radicals are thought to play a role in many destructive processes\nin the body, from cancer to coronary artery disease.\nPeroxisomes, on the other hand, oversee reactions that neutralize free radicals. Peroxisomes produce large amounts\nof the toxic H2O2 in the process, but peroxisomes contain enzymes that convert H2O2 into water and oxygen. These\nbyproducts are safely released into the cytoplasm. Like miniature sewage treatment plants, peroxisomes neutralize\nharmful toxins so that they do not wreak havoc in the cells. The liver is the organ primarily responsible for\ndetoxifying the blood before it travels throughout the body, and liver cells contain an exceptionally high number of\nperoxisomes.\nDefense mechanisms such as detoxification within the peroxisome and certain cellular antioxidants serve to\nneutralize many of these molecules. Some vitamins and other substances, found primarily in fruits and vegetables,\nhave antioxidant properties. Antioxidants work by being oxidized themselves, halting the destructive reaction\ncascades initiated by the free radicals. Sometimes though, ROS accumulate beyond the capacity of such defenses.\nOxidative stress is the term used to describe damage to cellular components caused by ROS. Due to their\ncharacteristic unpaired electrons, ROS can set off chain reactions where they remove electrons from other\nmolecules, which then become oxidized and reactive, and do the same to other molecules, causing a chain reaction.\nROS can cause permanent damage to cellular lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. Damaged DNA can\nlead to genetic mutations and even cancer. A mutation is a change in the nucleotide sequence in a gene within a\ncell’s DNA, potentially altering the protein coded by that gene. Other diseases believed to be triggered or\nexacerbated by ROS include Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, arthritis,\nHuntington’s disease, and schizophrenia, among many others.

In the former case, understanding how tissues\nrespond to damage can guide strategies to aid repair. In the latter case, understanding the impact of aging can help\nin the search for ways to diminish its effects.\nTissue Injury and Repair\nInflammation is the standard, initial response of the body to injury. Whether biological, chemical, physical, or\nradiation burns, all injuries lead to the same sequence of physiological events. Inflammation limits the extent of\ninjury, partially or fully eliminates the cause of injury, and initiates repair and regeneration of damaged tissue.\nNecrosis, or accidental cell death, causes inflammation.']","Autolysis is the process by which a cell breaks down and digests itself through its own enzymatic action, often triggered in response to damage or unhealthy conditions, leading to controlled cell death.","Autolysis is a 'self-destruct' mechanism in which lysosomes release their digestive enzymes into the cytoplasm of a cell, killing the cell."

Cells called hepatocytes in the liver detoxify many of these toxins.\nMitochondria\nA mitochondrion (plural = mitochondria) is a membranous, bean-shaped organelle that is the “energy transformer”\nof the cell. Mitochondria consist of an outer lipid bilayer membrane as well as an additional inner lipid bilayer\nmembrane (Figure 3.16). The inner membrane is highly folded into winding structures with a great deal of surface\narea, called cristae. It is along this inner membrane that a series of proteins, enzymes, and other molecules perform\nthe biochemical reactions of cellular respiration. These reactions convert energy stored in nutrient molecules (such\nas glucose) into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which provides usable cellular energy to the cell. Cells use ATP\nconstantly, and so the mitochondria are constantly at work. Oxygen molecules are required during cellular\nrespiration, which is why you must constantly breathe it in. One of the organ systems in the body that uses huge\namounts of ATP is the muscular system because ATP is required to sustain muscle contraction. As a result, muscle\ncells are packed full of mitochondria. Nerve cells also need large quantities of ATP to run their sodium-potassium\npumps. Therefore, an individual neuron will be loaded with over a thousand mitochondria. On the other hand, a bone\ncell, which is not nearly as metabolically-active, might only have a couple hundred mitochondria.\nFIGURE 3.16\nMitochondrion\nThe mitochondria are the energy-conversion factories of the cell.

When a cell divides, the DNA must be duplicated so that the each new cell receives a full\ncomplement of DNA. The following section will explore the structure of the nucleus and its contents, as well as the\nprocess of DNA replication.\nOrganization of the Nucleus and Its DNA\nLike most other cellular organelles, the nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear envelope. This\nmembranous covering consists of two adjacent lipid bilayers with a thin fluid space in between them. Spanning\nthese two bilayers are nuclear pores. A nuclear pore is a tiny passageway for the passage of proteins, RNA, and\nsolutes between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Proteins called pore complexes lining the nuclear pores regulate\n3.3 • The Nucleus and DNA Replication\n99\nthe passage of materials into and out of the nucleus.\nInside the nuclear envelope is a gel-like nucleoplasm with solutes that include the building blocks of nucleic acids.\nThere also can be a dark-staining mass often visible under a simple light microscope, called a nucleolus (plural =\nnucleoli). The nucleolus is a region of the nucleus that is responsible for manufacturing the RNA necessary for\nconstruction of ribosomes. Once synthesized, newly made ribosomal subunits exit the cell’s nucleus through the\nnuclear pores.\nThe genetic instructions that are used to build and maintain an organism are arranged in an orderly manner in\nstrands of DNA. Within the nucleus are threads of chromatin composed of DNA and associated proteins (Figure\n3.22). Along the chromatin threads, the DNA is wrapped around a set of histone proteins. A nucleosome is a single,\nwrapped DNA-histone complex. Multiple nucleosomes along the entire molecule of DNA appear like a beaded\nnecklace, in which the string is the DNA and the beads are the associated histones.', 'This nuclear envelope is studded with protein-\nlined pores that allow materials to be trafficked into\nand out of the nucleus. The nucleus contains one or\nmore nucleoli, which serve as sites for ribosome\nsynthesis. The nucleus houses the genetic material of\nthe cell: DNA. DNA is normally found as a loosely\ncontained structure called chromatin within the\nnucleus, where it is wound up and associated with a\nvariety of histone proteins. When a cell is about to\ndivide, the chromatin coils tightly and condenses to\nform chromosomes.\nThere is a pool of cells constantly dividing within your\nbody. The result is billions of new cells being created\neach day. Before any cell is ready to divide, it must\nreplicate its DNA so that each new daughter cell will\nreceive an exact copy of the organism’s genome. A\nvariety of enzymes are enlisted during DNA replication.\nThese enzymes unwind the DNA molecule, separate\nthe two strands, and assist with the building of\ncomplementary strands along each parent strand. The\noriginal DNA strands serve as templates from which\nthe nucleotide sequence of the new strands are\ndetermined and synthesized. When replication is\ncompleted, two identical DNA molecules exist. Each\none contains one original strand and one newly\nsynthesized complementary strand.\n3.4 Protein Synthesis\nDNA stores the information necessary for instructing\nthe cell to perform all of its functions. Cells use the\ngenetic code stored within DNA to build proteins,\nwhich ultimately determine the structure and function\nof the cell. This genetic code lies in the particular\nsequence of nucleotides that make up each gene along\nthe DNA molecule. To “read” this code, the cell must\nperform two sequential steps. In the first step,\ntranscription, the DNA code is converted into an RNA\ncode. A molecule of messenger RNA that is\ncomplementary to a specific gene is synthesized in a\nprocess similar to DNA replication. The molecule of\nmRNA provides the code to synthesize a protein. In the\nprocess of translation, the mRNA attaches to a\nribosome. Next, tRNA molecules shuttle the\nappropriate amino acids to the ribosome, one-by-one,\ncoded by sequential triplet codons on the mRNA, until\nthe protein is fully synthesized.', 'The\nendoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and\nlysosomes share a functional connectivity and are\ncollectively referred to as the endomembrane system.\nThere are two types of ER: smooth and rough. While\nthe smooth ER performs many functions, including lipid\nsynthesis and ion storage, the rough ER is mainly\nresponsible for protein synthesis using its associated\nribosomes. The rough ER sends newly made proteins\nto the Golgi apparatus where they are modified and\npackaged for delivery to various locations within or\noutside of the cell.

Proteins called pore complexes lining the nuclear pores regulate\n3.3 • The Nucleus and DNA Replication\n99\nthe passage of materials into and out of the nucleus.\nInside the nuclear envelope is a gel-like nucleoplasm with solutes that include the building blocks of nucleic acids.\nThere also can be a dark-staining mass often visible under a simple light microscope, called a nucleolus (plural =\nnucleoli). The nucleolus is a region of the nucleus that is responsible for manufacturing the RNA necessary for\nconstruction of ribosomes. Once synthesized, newly made ribosomal subunits exit the cell’s nucleus through the\nnuclear pores.\nThe genetic instructions that are used to build and maintain an organism are arranged in an orderly manner in\nstrands of DNA. Within the nucleus are threads of chromatin composed of DNA and associated proteins (Figure\n3.22). Along the chromatin threads, the DNA is wrapped around a set of histone proteins. A nucleosome is a single,\nwrapped DNA-histone complex. Multiple nucleosomes along the entire molecule of DNA appear like a beaded\nnecklace, in which the string is the DNA and the beads are the associated histones.']","Mature red blood cells (RBCs) do not contain nuclei, as they eject their nuclei during maturation to make space for hemoglobin.","Mature red blood cells lack a nucleus, as they eject their nuclei as they mature, making room for the large numbers of hemoglobin molecules that carry oxygen throughout the body."
What is the intermediate messenger that leaves the nucleus and manages protein synthesis?,"['For example, the DNA triplet CAC (cytosine, adenine, and cytosine) specifies the\namino acid valine. Therefore, a gene, which is composed of multiple triplets in a unique sequence, provides the code\nto build an entire protein, with multiple amino acids in the proper sequence (Figure 3.25). The mechanism by which\ncells turn the DNA code into a protein product is a two-step process, with an RNA molecule as the intermediate.\nFIGURE 3.25\nThe Genetic Code\nDNA holds all of the genetic information necessary to build a cell’s proteins. The nucleotide sequence\nof a gene is ultimately translated into an amino acid sequence of the gene’s corresponding protein.\nFrom DNA to RNA: Transcription\nDNA is housed within the nucleus, and protein synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm, thus there must be some sort\nof intermediate messenger that leaves the nucleus and manages protein synthesis. This intermediate messenger is\nmessenger RNA (mRNA), a single-stranded nucleic acid that carries a copy of the genetic code for a single gene out\nof the nucleus and into the cytoplasm where it is used to produce proteins.\nThere are several different types of RNA, each having different functions in the cell. The structure of RNA is similar\nto DNA with a few small exceptions. For one thing, unlike DNA, most types of RNA, including mRNA, are single-\nstranded and contain no complementary strand. Second, the ribose sugar in RNA contains an additional oxygen\n3.4 • Protein Synthesis\n103\natom compared with DNA. Finally, instead of the base thymine, RNA contains the base uracil. This means that\nadenine will always pair up with uracil during the protein synthesis process.\nGene expression begins with the process called transcription, which is the synthesis of a strand of mRNA that is\ncomplementary to the gene of interest. This process is called transcription because the mRNA is like a transcript, or\ncopy, of the gene’s DNA code. Transcription begins in a fashion somewhat like DNA replication, in that a region of\nDNA unwinds and the two strands separate, however, only that small portion of the DNA will be split apart. The\ntriplets within the gene on this section of the DNA molecule are used as the template to transcribe the\ncomplementary strand of RNA (Figure 3.26).', 'This fold causes the RNA to separate from the gene and from RNA polymerase, ending\ntranscription.\nBefore the mRNA molecule leaves the nucleus and proceeds to protein synthesis, it is modified in a number of ways.\nFor this reason, it is often called a pre-mRNA at this stage. For example, your DNA, and thus complementary mRNA,\ncontains long regions called non-coding regions that do not code for amino acids. Their function is still a mystery,\nbut the process called splicing removes these non-coding regions from the pre-mRNA transcript (Figure 3.27). A\nspliceosome—a structure composed of various proteins and other molecules—attaches to the mRNA and “splices”\nor cuts out the non-coding regions. The removed segment of the transcript is called an intron. The remaining exons\nare pasted together. An exon is a segment of RNA that remains after splicing. Interestingly, some introns that are\nremoved from mRNA are not always non-coding. When different coding regions of mRNA are spliced out, different\nvariations of the protein will eventually result, with differences in structure and function. This process results in a\nmuch larger variety of possible proteins and protein functions. When the mRNA transcript is ready, it travels out of\nthe nucleus and into the cytoplasm.\n104\n3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 3.27\nSplicing DNA\nIn the nucleus, a structure called a spliceosome cuts out introns (noncoding regions) within a pre-mRNA\ntranscript and reconnects the exons.\nFrom RNA to Protein: Translation\nLike translating a book from one language into another, the codons on a strand of mRNA must be translated into the\namino acid alphabet of proteins. Translation is the process of synthesizing a chain of amino acids called a\npolypeptide. Translation requires two major aids: first, a “translator,” the molecule that will conduct the translation,\nand second, a substrate on which the mRNA strand is translated into a new protein, like the translator’s “desk.” Both\nof these requirements are fulfilled by other types of RNA. The substrate on which translation takes place is the\nribosome.\nRemember that many of a cell’s ribosomes are found associated with the rough ER, and carry out the synthesis of\nproteins destined for the Golgi apparatus.', 'The final cytoskeletal filament is the intermediate filament. As its name would suggest, an intermediate filament is\na filament intermediate in thickness between the microtubules and microfilaments (see Figure 3.18c). Intermediate\nfilaments are made up of long fibrous subunits of a protein called keratin that are wound together like the threads\nthat compose a rope. Intermediate filaments, in concert with the microtubules, are important for maintaining cell\nshape and structure. Unlike the microtubules, which resist compression, intermediate filaments resist tension—the\nforces that pull apart cells. There are many cases in which cells are prone to tension, such as when epithelial cells of\nthe skin are compressed, tugging them in different directions. Intermediate filaments help anchor organelles\ntogether within a cell and also link cells to other cells by forming special cell-to-cell junctions.\n3.3 The Nucleus and DNA Replication\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe the structure and features of the nuclear membrane\n•\nList the contents of the nucleus\n•\nExplain the organization of the DNA molecule within the nucleus\n•\nDescribe the process of DNA replication\nThe nucleus is the largest and most prominent of a cell’s organelles (Figure 3.19).

Other cells, such as mammalian red blood cells (RBCs), do not contain nuclei at all. RBCs\neject their nuclei as they mature, making space for the large numbers of hemoglobin molecules that carry oxygen\nthroughout the body (Figure 3.21).

Where does protein synthesis take place?,"['Each new DNA molecule contains one strand from the original molecule and one newly synthesized strand. The term\nfor this mode of replication is “semiconservative,” because half of the original DNA molecule is conserved in each\nnew DNA molecule. This process continues until the cell’s entire genome, the entire complement of an organism’s\nDNA, is replicated. As you might imagine, it is very important that DNA replication take place precisely so that new\ncells in the body contain the exact same genetic material as their parent cells. Mistakes made during DNA\nreplication, such as the accidental addition of an inappropriate nucleotide, have the potential to render a gene\ndysfunctional or useless. Fortunately, there are mechanisms in place to minimize such mistakes. A DNA\nproofreading process enlists the help of special enzymes that scan the newly synthesized molecule for mistakes and\ncorrects them. Once the process of DNA replication is complete, the cell is ready to divide. You will explore the\nprocess of cell division later in the chapter.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/DNArep) to learn about DNA replication.

A ribosome is an organelle that serves as the site of protein synthesis. It is composed of two\nribosomal RNA subunits that wrap around mRNA to start the process of translation, followed by protein synthesis.\nSmooth ER (SER) lacks these ribosomes.\nOne of the main functions of the smooth ER is in the synthesis of lipids. The smooth ER synthesizes phospholipids,\nthe main component of biological membranes, as well as steroid hormones. For this reason, cells that produce large\nquantities of such hormones, such as those of the female ovaries and male testes, contain large amounts of smooth\nER. In addition to lipid synthesis, the smooth ER also sequesters (i.e., stores) and regulates the concentration of\ncellular Ca++, a function extremely important in cells of the nervous system where Ca++ is the trigger for\nneurotransmitter release. The smooth ER additionally metabolizes some carbohydrates and performs a\ndetoxification role, breaking down certain toxins.\nIn contrast with the smooth ER, the primary job of the rough ER is the synthesis and modification of proteins\ndestined for the cell membrane or for export from the cell. For this protein synthesis, many ribosomes attach to the\nER (giving it the studded appearance of rough ER). Typically, a protein is synthesized within the ribosome and\nreleased inside the channel of the rough ER, where sugars can be added to it (by a process called glycosylation)\nbefore it is transported within a vesicle to the next stage in the packaging and shipping process: the Golgi apparatus.\nThe Golgi Apparatus\nThe Golgi apparatus is responsible for sorting, modifying, and shipping off the products that come from the rough\n3.2 • The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles\n93\nER, much like a post-office. The Golgi apparatus looks like stacked flattened discs, almost like stacks of oddly\nshaped pancakes. Like the ER, these discs are membranous. The Golgi apparatus has two distinct sides, each with a\ndifferent role. One side of the apparatus receives products in vesicles.', 'The\nendoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and\nlysosomes share a functional connectivity and are\ncollectively referred to as the endomembrane system.\nThere are two types of ER: smooth and rough. While\nthe smooth ER performs many functions, including lipid\nsynthesis and ion storage, the rough ER is mainly\nresponsible for protein synthesis using its associated\nribosomes. The rough ER sends newly made proteins\nto the Golgi apparatus where they are modified and\npackaged for delivery to various locations within or\noutside of the cell. Some of these protein products are\nenzymes destined to break down unwanted material\nand are packaged as lysosomes for use inside the cell.\nCells also contain mitochondria and peroxisomes,\nwhich are the organelles responsible for producing the\ncell’s energy supply and detoxifying certain chemicals,\nrespectively. Biochemical reactions within\nmitochondria transform energy-carrying molecules into\nthe usable form of cellular energy known as ATP.\nPeroxisomes contain enzymes that transform harmful\nsubstances such as free radicals into oxygen and water.\nCells also contain a miniaturized “skeleton” of protein\nfilaments that extend throughout its interior. Three\ndifferent kinds of filaments compose this cytoskeleton\n(in order of increasing thickness): microfilaments,\nintermediate filaments, and microtubules. Each\ncytoskeletal component performs unique functions as\nwell as provides a supportive framework for the cell.\n3.3 The Nucleus and DNA Replication\nThe nucleus is the command center of the cell,\ncontaining the genetic instructions for all of the\nmaterials a cell will make (and thus all of its functions it\ncan perform). The nucleus is encased within a\nmembrane of two interconnected lipid bilayers, side-\nby-side. This nuclear envelope is studded with protein-\nlined pores that allow materials to be trafficked into\nand out of the nucleus. The nucleus contains one or\nmore nucleoli, which serve as sites for ribosome\nsynthesis. The nucleus houses the genetic material of\nthe cell: DNA. DNA is normally found as a loosely\ncontained structure called chromatin within the\nnucleus, where it is wound up and associated with a\nvariety of histone proteins. When a cell is about to\ndivide, the chromatin coils tightly and condenses to\nform chromosomes.']","Protein synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm, where ribosomes translate messenger RNA (mRNA) into proteins.",the cytoplasm
What is the G0 phase of the cell cycle?,"['Cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm into two distinctive cells.\nInterphase\nA cell grows and carries out all normal metabolic functions and processes in a period called G1 (Figure 3.30). G1\nphase (gap 1 phase) is the first gap, or growth phase in the cell cycle. For cells that will divide again, G1 is followed\nby replication of the DNA, during the S phase. The S phase (synthesis phase) is period during which a cell replicates\nits DNA.\nFIGURE 3.30\nCell Cycle\nThe two major phases of the cell cycle include mitosis (designated M), when the cell divides, and interphase,\nwhen the cell grows and performs all of its normal functions. Interphase is further subdivided into G1, S, and G2 phases.\nAfter the synthesis phase, the cell proceeds through the G2 phase. The G2 phase is a second gap phase, during\nwhich the cell continues to grow and makes the necessary preparations for mitosis. Between G1, S, and G2 phases,\ncells will vary the most in their duration of the G1 phase. It is here that a cell might spend a couple of hours, or many\ndays. The S phase typically lasts between 8-10 hours and the G2 phase approximately 5 hours. In contrast to these\nphases, the G0 phase is a resting phase of the cell cycle. Cells that have temporarily stopped dividing and are resting\n(a common condition) and cells that have permanently ceased dividing (like nerve cells) are said to be in G0.\nThe Structure of Chromosomes\nBillions of cells in the human body divide every day.

The process is then followed by cytokinesis.\nFIGURE 3.32\nCell Division: Mitosis Followed by Cytokinesis\nThe stages of cell division oversee the separation of identical genetic\nmaterial into two new nuclei, followed by the division of the cytoplasm.\n3.5 • Cell Growth and Division\n109\nProphase is the first phase of mitosis, during which the loosely packed chromatin coils and condenses into visible\nchromosomes.']","The G0 phase is a resting phase of the cell cycle where cells have temporarily stopped dividing or have permanently ceased to divide, such as certain nerve and muscle cells. It is typically entered from the G1 phase and can last for extended periods.","The G0 phase is a resting phase of the cell cycle, where cells that have temporarily stopped dividing and are resting, or cells that have permanently ceased dividing, such as nerve cells, are said to be in G0."
What is the function of the centromere in a cell?,"['Cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm into two distinctive cells.\nInterphase\nA cell grows and carries out all normal metabolic functions and processes in a period called G1 (Figure 3.30). G1\nphase (gap 1 phase) is the first gap, or growth phase in the cell cycle. For cells that will divide again, G1 is followed\nby replication of the DNA, during the S phase. The S phase (synthesis phase) is period during which a cell replicates\nits DNA.\nFIGURE 3.30\nCell Cycle\nThe two major phases of the cell cycle include mitosis (designated M), when the cell divides, and interphase,\nwhen the cell grows and performs all of its normal functions. Interphase is further subdivided into G1, S, and G2 phases.\nAfter the synthesis phase, the cell proceeds through the G2 phase. The G2 phase is a second gap phase, during\nwhich the cell continues to grow and makes the necessary preparations for mitosis. Between G1, S, and G2 phases,\ncells will vary the most in their duration of the G1 phase. It is here that a cell might spend a couple of hours, or many\ndays. The S phase typically lasts between 8-10 hours and the G2 phase approximately 5 hours. In contrast to these\nphases, the G0 phase is a resting phase of the cell cycle. Cells that have temporarily stopped dividing and are resting\n(a common condition) and cells that have permanently ceased dividing (like nerve cells) are said to be in G0.\nThe Structure of Chromosomes\nBillions of cells in the human body divide every day. During the synthesis phase (S, for DNA synthesis) of interphase,\nthe amount of DNA within the cell precisely doubles. Therefore, after DNA replication but before cell division, each\ncell actually contains two copies of each chromosome. Each copy of the chromosome is referred to as a sister\nchromatid and is physically bound to the other copy.(Note that the term ""sister chromatid"" is used regardless of the\nsex of the person.) The centromere is the structure that attaches one sister chromatid to another. Because a human\ncell has 46 chromosomes, during this phase, there are 92 chromatids (46 × 2) in the cell.', 'The kinetochore is a protein structure on the centromere that is the point of attachment\nbetween the mitotic spindle and the sister chromatids. This stage is referred to as late prophase or “prometaphase”\nto indicate the transition between prophase and metaphase.\nMetaphase is the second stage of mitosis. During this stage, the sister chromatids, with their attached microtubules,\nline up along a linear plane in the middle of the cell. A metaphase plate forms between the centrosomes that are\nnow located at either end of the cell. The metaphase plate is the name for the plane through the center of the\nspindle on which the sister chromatids are positioned. The microtubules are now poised to pull apart the sister\nchromatids and bring one from each pair to each side of the cell.\nAnaphase is the third stage of mitosis. Anaphase takes place over a few minutes, when the pairs of sister\nchromatids are separated from one another, forming individual chromosomes once again. These chromosomes are\npulled to opposite ends of the cell by their kinetochores, as the microtubules shorten. Each end of the cell receives\none partner from each pair of sister chromatids, ensuring that the two new daughter cells will contain identical\ngenetic material.\nTelophase is the final stage of mitosis. Telophase is characterized by the formation of two new daughter nuclei at\neither end of the dividing cell. These newly formed nuclei surround the genetic material, which uncoils such that the\nchromosomes return to loosely packed chromatin. Nucleoli also reappear within the new nuclei, and the mitotic\nspindle breaks apart, each new cell receiving its own complement of DNA, organelles, membranes, and centrioles.\nAt this point, the cell is already beginning to split in half as cytokinesis begins.\nThe cleavage furrow is a contractile band made up of microfilaments that forms around the midline of the cell\nduring cytokinesis. (Recall that microfilaments consist of actin.) This contractile band squeezes the two cells apart\nuntil they finally separate. Two new cells are now formed. One of these cells (the “stem cell”) enters its own cell\ncycle; able to grow and divide again at some future time.', 'Therefore, after DNA replication but before cell division, each\ncell actually contains two copies of each chromosome.

Make sure not to confuse\nthe concept of a pair of chromatids (one chromosome and its exact copy attached during mitosis) and a homologous\npair of chromosomes (two paired chromosomes which were inherited separately, one from each parent) (Figure\n3.31).\n108\n3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 3.31\nA Homologous Pair of Chromosomes with their Attached Sister Chromatids\nThe red and blue colors correspond to a\nhomologous pair of chromosomes. Each member of the pair was separately inherited from one parent. Each chromosome in the\nhomologous pair is also bound to an identical sister chromatid, which is produced by DNA replication, and results in the familiar “X” shape.\nMitosis and Cytokinesis\nThe mitotic phase of the cell typically takes between 1 and 2 hours. During this phase, a cell undergoes two major\nprocesses. First, it completes mitosis, during which the contents of the nucleus are equitably pulled apart and\ndistributed between its two halves. Cytokinesis then occurs, dividing the cytoplasm and cell body into two new cells.\nMitosis is divided into four major stages that take place after interphase (Figure 3.32) and in the following order:\nprophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.

One of these cells (the “stem cell”) enters its own cell\ncycle; able to grow and divide again at some future time. The other cell transforms into the functional cell of the\ntissue, typically replacing an “old” cell there.\nImagine a cell that completed mitosis but never underwent cytokinesis. In some cases, a cell may divide its genetic\nmaterial and grow in size, but fail to undergo cytokinesis. This results in larger cells with more than one nucleus.\nUsually this is an unwanted aberration and can be a sign of cancerous cells.\nCell Cycle Control\nA very elaborate and precise system of regulation controls direct the way cells proceed from one phase to the next\nin the cell cycle and begin mitosis. The control system involves molecules within the cell as well as external triggers.\nThese internal and external control triggers provide “stop” and “advance” signals for the cell. Precise regulation of\nthe cell cycle is critical for maintaining the health of an organism, and loss of cell cycle control can lead to cancer.\nMechanisms of Cell Cycle Control\nAs the cell proceeds through its cycle, each phase involves certain processes that must be completed before the cell\nshould advance to the next phase. A checkpoint is a point in the cell cycle at which the cycle can be signaled to\nmove forward or stopped. At each of these checkpoints, different varieties of molecules provide the stop or go\n110\n3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nsignals, depending on certain conditions within the cell. A cyclin is one of the primary classes of cell cycle control\nmolecules (Figure 3.33). A cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) is one of a group of molecules that work together with\ncyclins to determine progression past cell checkpoints. By interacting with many additional molecules, these\ntriggers push the cell cycle forward unless prevented from doing so by “stop” signals, if for some reason the cell is\nnot ready.', 'The process is then followed by cytokinesis.\nFIGURE 3.32\nCell Division: Mitosis Followed by Cytokinesis\nThe stages of cell division oversee the separation of identical genetic\nmaterial into two new nuclei, followed by the division of the cytoplasm.\n3.5 • Cell Growth and Division\n109\nProphase is the first phase of mitosis, during which the loosely packed chromatin coils and condenses into visible\nchromosomes. During prophase, each chromosome becomes visible with its identical partner attached, forming the\nfamiliar X-shape of sister chromatids. The nucleolus disappears early during this phase, and the nuclear envelope\nalso disintegrates.\nA major occurrence during prophase concerns a very important structure that contains the origin site for\nmicrotubule growth. Recall the cellular structures called centrioles that serve as origin points from which\nmicrotubules extend. These tiny structures also play a very important role during mitosis. A centrosome is a pair of\ncentrioles together. The cell contains two centrosomes side-by-side, which begin to move apart during prophase. As\nthe centrosomes migrate to two different sides of the cell, microtubules begin to extend from each like long fingers\nfrom two hands extending toward each other. The mitotic spindle is the structure composed of the centrosomes\nand their emerging microtubules.\nNear the end of prophase there is an invasion of the nuclear area by microtubules from the mitotic spindle. The\nnuclear membrane has disintegrated, and the microtubules attach themselves to the centromeres that adjoin pairs\nof sister chromatids. The kinetochore is a protein structure on the centromere that is the point of attachment\nbetween the mitotic spindle and the sister chromatids. This stage is referred to as late prophase or “prometaphase”\nto indicate the transition between prophase and metaphase.\nMetaphase is the second stage of mitosis. During this stage, the sister chromatids, with their attached microtubules,\nline up along a linear plane in the middle of the cell.

It serves as the attachment point for the kinetochore, which connects the chromatids to the mitotic spindle.",The centromere is the structure that attaches one sister chromatid to another.
What is the role of tumor suppressor genes in a cell's 'cruise control system'?,"['Similarly, the cell includes molecular messengers, such as cyclins, that push the cell forward in its cycle.\nIn addition to cyclins, a class of proteins that are encoded by genes called proto-oncogenes provide important\nsignals that regulate the cell cycle and move it forward. Examples of proto-oncogene products include cell-surface\nreceptors for growth factors, or cell-signaling molecules, two classes of molecules that can promote DNA replication\nand cell division. In contrast, a second class of genes known as tumor suppressor genes sends stop signals during a\ncell cycle. For example, certain protein products of tumor suppressor genes signal potential problems with the DNA\nand thus stop the cell from dividing, while other proteins signal the cell to die if it is damaged beyond repair. Some\ntumor suppressor proteins also signal a sufficient surrounding cellular density, which indicates that the cell need not\npresently divide. The latter function is uniquely important in preventing tumor growth: normal cells exhibit a\nphenomenon called “contact inhibition;” thus, extensive cellular contact with neighboring cells causes a signal that\nstops further cell division.\nThese two contrasting classes of genes, proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, are like the accelerator and\nbrake pedal of the cell’s own “cruise control system,” respectively. Under normal conditions, these stop and go\nsignals are maintained in a homeostatic balance. Generally speaking, there are two ways that the cell’s cruise\ncontrol can lose control: a malfunctioning (overactive) accelerator, or a malfunctioning (underactive) brake. When\ncompromised through a mutation, or otherwise altered, proto-oncogenes can be converted to oncogenes, which\nproduce oncoproteins that push a cell forward in its cycle and stimulate cell division even when it is undesirable to\ndo so. For example, a cell that should be programmed to self-destruct (a process called apoptosis) due to extensive\nDNA damage might instead be triggered to proliferate by an oncoprotein. On the other hand, a dysfunctional tumor\nsuppressor gene may fail to provide the cell with a necessary stop signal, also resulting in unwanted cell division and\nproliferation.\nA delicate homeostatic balance between the many proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes delicately\ncontrols the cell cycle and ensures that only healthy cells replicate.', 'Environmental insult that damages DNA can also cause dysfunction in those signals. Often, a combination of\nboth genetic predisposition and environmental factors lead to cancer.\nThe process of a cell escaping its normal control system and becoming cancerous may actually happen throughout\nthe body quite frequently. Fortunately, certain cells of the immune system are capable of recognizing cells that have\nbecome cancerous and destroying them. However, in certain cases the cancerous cells remain undetected and\ncontinue to proliferate. If the resulting tumor does not pose a threat to surrounding tissues, it is said to be benign\nand can usually be easily removed. If capable of damage, the tumor is considered malignant and the patient is\ndiagnosed with cancer.\nHOMEOSTATIC IMBALANCES\nCancer Arises from Homeostatic Imbalances\nCancer is an extremely complex condition, capable of arising from a wide variety of genetic and environmental\ncauses. Typically, mutations or aberrations in a cell’s DNA that compromise normal cell cycle control systems lead\nto cancerous tumors. Cell cycle control is an example of a homeostatic mechanism that maintains proper cell\nfunction and health. While progressing through the phases of the cell cycle, a large variety of intracellular molecules\n3.5 • Cell Growth and Division\n111\nprovide stop and go signals to regulate movement forward to the next phase. These signals are maintained in an\nintricate balance so that the cell only proceeds to the next phase when it is ready. This homeostatic control of the\ncell cycle can be thought of like a car’s cruise control. Cruise control will continually apply just the right amount of\nacceleration to maintain a desired speed, unless the driver hits the brakes, in which case the car will slow down.\nSimilarly, the cell includes molecular messengers, such as cyclins, that push the cell forward in its cycle.\nIn addition to cyclins, a class of proteins that are encoded by genes called proto-oncogenes provide important\nsignals that regulate the cell cycle and move it forward.

Uncontrolled growth, invasion\ninto adjacent tissues, and colonization of other organs, if not treated early enough, are its hallmarks. Health suffers\nwhen tumors “rob” blood supply from the “normal” organs.\nA mutation is defined as a permanent change in the DNA of a cell. Epigenetic modifications, changes that do not\naffect the code of the DNA but alter how the DNA is decoded, are also known to generate abnormal cells. Alterations\nin the genetic material may be caused by environmental agents, infectious agents, or errors in the replication of DNA\nthat accumulate with age. Many mutations do not cause any noticeable change in the functions of a cell. However, if\nthe modification affects key proteins that have an impact on the cell’s ability to proliferate in an orderly fashion, the\ncell starts to divide abnormally. As changes in cells accumulate, they lose their ability to form regular tissues. A\ntumor, a mass of cells displaying abnormal architecture, forms in the tissue. Many tumors are benign, meaning they\ndo not metastasize nor cause disease. A tumor becomes malignant, or cancerous, when it breaches the confines of\nits tissue, promotes angiogenesis, attracts the growth of capillaries, and metastasizes to other organs (Figure 4.22).\nThe specific names of cancers reflect the tissue of origin. Cancers derived from epithelial cells are referred to as\ncarcinomas. Cancer in myeloid tissue or blood cells form myelomas. Leukemias are cancers of white blood cells,\nwhereas sarcomas derive from connective tissue. Cells in tumors differ both in structure and function. Some cells,\ncalled cancer stem cells, appear to be a subtype of cell responsible for uncontrolled growth. Recent research shows\nthat contrary to what was previously assumed, tumors are not disorganized masses of cells, but have their own\nstructures.\n4.6 • Tissue Injury and Aging\n153\nFIGURE 4.22\nDevelopment of Cancer\nNote the change in cell size, nucleus size, and organization in the tissue.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nWatch this video (http://openstax.org/l/tumor) to learn more about tumors.

What is the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)?,"['The organelles of the endomembrane system include the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi\napparatus, and vesicles.\nEndoplasmic Reticulum\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a system of channels that is continuous with the nuclear membrane (or\n“envelope”) covering the nucleus and composed of the same lipid bilayer material. The ER can be thought of as a\nseries of winding thoroughfares similar to the waterway canals in Venice. The ER provides passages throughout\nmuch of the cell that function in transporting, synthesizing, and storing materials. The winding structure of the ER\nresults in a large membranous surface area that supports its many functions (Figure 3.14).\n92\n3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 3.14\nEndoplasmic Reticulum (ER)\n(a) The ER is a winding network of thin membranous sacs found in close association with\nthe cell nucleus.

EM × 110,510. (Micrographs provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School\n© 2012)\nEndoplasmic reticulum can exist in two forms: rough ER and smooth ER. These two types of ER perform some very\ndifferent functions and can be found in very different amounts depending on the type of cell. Rough ER (RER) is so-\ncalled because its membrane is dotted with embedded granules—organelles called ribosomes, giving the RER a\nbumpy appearance. A ribosome is an organelle that serves as the site of protein synthesis. It is composed of two\nribosomal RNA subunits that wrap around mRNA to start the process of translation, followed by protein synthesis.\nSmooth ER (SER) lacks these ribosomes.\nOne of the main functions of the smooth ER is in the synthesis of lipids.', 'The\nendoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, and\nlysosomes share a functional connectivity and are\ncollectively referred to as the endomembrane system.\nThere are two types of ER: smooth and rough. While\nthe smooth ER performs many functions, including lipid\nsynthesis and ion storage, the rough ER is mainly\nresponsible for protein synthesis using its associated\nribosomes. The rough ER sends newly made proteins\nto the Golgi apparatus where they are modified and\npackaged for delivery to various locations within or\noutside of the cell. Some of these protein products are\nenzymes destined to break down unwanted material\nand are packaged as lysosomes for use inside the cell.\nCells also contain mitochondria and peroxisomes,\nwhich are the organelles responsible for producing the\ncell’s energy supply and detoxifying certain chemicals,\nrespectively. Biochemical reactions within\nmitochondria transform energy-carrying molecules into\nthe usable form of cellular energy known as ATP.\nPeroxisomes contain enzymes that transform harmful\nsubstances such as free radicals into oxygen and water.\nCells also contain a miniaturized “skeleton” of protein\nfilaments that extend throughout its interior. Three\ndifferent kinds of filaments compose this cytoskeleton\n(in order of increasing thickness): microfilaments,\nintermediate filaments, and microtubules. Each\ncytoskeletal component performs unique functions as\nwell as provides a supportive framework for the cell.\n3.3 The Nucleus and DNA Replication\nThe nucleus is the command center of the cell,\ncontaining the genetic instructions for all of the\nmaterials a cell will make (and thus all of its functions it\ncan perform). The nucleus is encased within a\nmembrane of two interconnected lipid bilayers, side-\nby-side. This nuclear envelope is studded with protein-\nlined pores that allow materials to be trafficked into\nand out of the nucleus. The nucleus contains one or\nmore nucleoli, which serve as sites for ribosome\nsynthesis. The nucleus houses the genetic material of\nthe cell: DNA. DNA is normally found as a loosely\ncontained structure called chromatin within the\nnucleus, where it is wound up and associated with a\nvariety of histone proteins. When a cell is about to\ndivide, the chromatin coils tightly and condenses to\nform chromosomes.', 'The transport\nof Cl– and the maintenance of an electronegative environment outside of the cell attract positive ions such as\nNa+ to the extracellular space. The accumulation of both Cl– and Na+ ions in the extracellular space creates\nsolute-rich mucus, which has a low concentration of water molecules. As a result, through osmosis, water\nmoves from cells and extracellular matrix into the mucus, “thinning” it out. This is how, in a normal respiratory\nsystem, the mucus is kept sufficiently watered-down to be propelled out of the respiratory system.\nIf the CFTR channel is absent, Cl– ions are not transported out of the cell in adequate numbers, thus preventing\nthem from drawing positive ions. The absence of ions in the secreted mucus results in the lack of a normal water\nconcentration gradient. Thus, there is no osmotic pressure pulling water into the mucus. The resulting mucus is\nthick and sticky, and the ciliated epithelia cannot effectively remove it from the respiratory system. Passageways\nin the lungs become blocked with mucus, along with the debris it carries. Bacterial infections occur more easily\nbecause bacterial cells are not effectively carried away from the lungs.\n3.2 • The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles\n91\nFIGURE 3.13\nPrototypical Human Cell\nWhile this image is not indicative of any one particular human cell, it is a prototypical example\nof a cell containing the primary organelles and internal structures.\nOrganelles of the Endomembrane System\nA set of three major organelles together form a system within the cell called the endomembrane system. These\norganelles work together to perform various cellular jobs, including the task of producing, packaging, and exporting\ncertain cellular products. The organelles of the endomembrane system include the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi\napparatus, and vesicles.\nEndoplasmic Reticulum\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a system of channels that is continuous with the nuclear membrane (or\n“envelope”) covering the nucleus and composed of the same lipid bilayer material. The ER can be thought of as a\nseries of winding thoroughfares similar to the waterway canals in Venice.', '1 The Cell Membrane\nThe cell membrane provides a barrier around the cell,\nseparating its internal components from the\nextracellular environment. It is composed of a\nphospholipid bilayer, with hydrophobic internal lipid\n“tails” and hydrophilic external phosphate “heads.”\nVarious membrane proteins are scattered throughout\nthe bilayer, both inserted within it and attached to it\nperipherally. The cell membrane is selectively\npermeable, allowing only a limited number of materials\nto diffuse through its lipid bilayer. All materials that\ncross the membrane do so using passive (non energy-\nrequiring) or active (energy-requiring) transport\nprocesses. During passive transport, materials move by\nsimple diffusion or by facilitated diffusion through the\nmembrane, down their concentration gradient.

During active transport, energy is\nexpended to assist material movement across the\nmembrane in a direction against their concentration\ngradient. Active transport may take place with the help\nof protein pumps or through the use of vesicles.\n3.2 The Cytoplasm and Cellular Organelles\nThe internal environmental of a living cell is made up of\na fluid, jelly-like substance called cytosol, which\nconsists mainly of water, but also contains various\ndissolved nutrients and other molecules. The cell\ncontains an array of cellular organelles, each one\nperforming a unique function and helping to maintain\nthe health and activity of the cell.

Where is the glycocalyx located?,"['Some integral membrane proteins are glycoproteins. A glycoprotein is a protein that has carbohydrate molecules\nattached, which extend into the extracellular matrix. The attached carbohydrate tags on glycoproteins aid in cell\nrecognition. The carbohydrates that extend from membrane proteins and even from some membrane lipids\ncollectively form the glycocalyx. The glycocalyx is a fuzzy-appearing coating around the cell formed from\nglycoproteins and other carbohydrates attached to the cell membrane. The glycocalyx can have various roles. For\nexample, it may have molecules that allow the cell to bind to another cell, it may contain receptors for hormones, or\nit might have enzymes to break down nutrients. The glycocalyces found in a person’s body are products of that\nperson’s genetic makeup. They give each of the individual’s trillions of cells the “identity” of belonging in the\nperson’s body. This identity is the primary way that a person’s immune defense cells “know” not to attack the\nperson’s own body cells, but it also is the reason organs donated by another person might be rejected.\nPeripheral proteins are typically found on the inner or outer surface of the lipid bilayer but can also be attached to\nthe internal or external surface of an integral protein. These proteins typically perform a specific function for the\ncell. Some peripheral proteins on the surface of intestinal cells, for example, act as digestive enzymes to break down\nnutrients to sizes that can pass through the cells and into the bloodstream.\nTransport across the Cell Membrane\nOne of the great wonders of the cell membrane is its ability to regulate the concentration of substances inside the\ncell. These substances include ions such as Ca++, Na+, K+, and Cl–; nutrients including sugars, fatty acids, and amino\nacids; and waste products, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), which must leave the cell.\nThe membrane’s lipid bilayer structure provides the first level of control. The phospholipids are tightly packed\ntogether, and the membrane has a hydrophobic interior. This structure causes the membrane to be selectively\npermeable. A membrane that has selective permeability allows only substances meeting certain criteria to pass\nthrough it unaided.', 'FIGURE 3.3\nPhospholipid Bilayer\nThe phospholipid bilayer consists of two adjacent sheets of phospholipids, arranged tail to tail. The\nhydrophobic tails associate with one another, forming the interior of the membrane. The polar heads contact the fluid inside and outside of\nthe cell.\nMembrane Proteins\nThe lipid bilayer forms the basis of the cell membrane, but it is peppered throughout with various proteins. Two\ndifferent types of proteins that are commonly associated with the cell membrane are the integral proteins and\nperipheral protein (Figure 3.4). As its name suggests, an integral protein is a protein that is embedded in the\nmembrane. A channel protein is an example of an integral protein that selectively allows particular materials, such\n3.1 • The Cell Membrane\n83\nas certain ions, to pass into or out of the cell.\nFIGURE 3.4\nCell Membrane\nThe cell membrane of the cell is a phospholipid bilayer containing many different molecular components,\nincluding proteins and cholesterol, some with carbohydrate groups attached.\nAnother important group of integral proteins are cell recognition proteins, which serve to mark a cell’s identity so\nthat it can be recognized by other cells. A receptor is a type of recognition protein that can selectively bind a specific\nmolecule outside the cell, and this binding induces a chemical reaction within the cell. A ligand is the specific\nmolecule that binds to and activates a receptor. Some integral proteins serve dual roles as both a receptor and an\nion channel. One example of a receptor-ligand interaction is the receptors on nerve cells that bind\nneurotransmitters, such as dopamine. When a dopamine molecule binds to a dopamine receptor protein, a channel\nwithin the transmembrane protein opens to allow certain ions to flow into the cell.\nSome integral membrane proteins are glycoproteins. A glycoprotein is a protein that has carbohydrate molecules\nattached, which extend into the extracellular matrix. The attached carbohydrate tags on glycoproteins aid in cell\nrecognition. The carbohydrates that extend from membrane proteins and even from some membrane lipids\ncollectively form the glycocalyx.

It is a stratified squamous epithelial\nmembrane resting on top of connective tissue. The apical surface of this membrane is exposed to the external\nenvironment and is covered with dead, keratinized cells that help protect the body from desiccation and pathogens.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the structure and function of epithelial tissue\n•\nDistinguish between tight junctions, anchoring junctions, and gap junctions\n•\nDistinguish between simple epithelia and stratified epithelia, as well as between squamous, cuboidal, and\ncolumnar epithelia\n•\nDescribe the structure and function of endocrine and exocrine glands and their respective secretions\nMost epithelial tissues are essentially large sheets of cells covering all the surfaces of the body exposed to the\noutside world and lining the outside of organs. Epithelium also forms much of the glandular tissue of the body. Skin\nis not the only area of the body exposed to the outside. Other areas include the airways, the digestive tract, as well\nas the urinary and reproductive systems, all of which are lined by an epithelium. Hollow organs and body cavities\nthat do not connect to the exterior of the body, which includes, blood vessels and serous membranes, are lined by\nendothelium (plural = endothelia), which is a type of epithelium.\nEpithelial cells derive from all three major embryonic layers. The epithelia lining the skin, parts of the mouth and\nnose, and the anus develop from the ectoderm. Cells lining the airways and most of the digestive system originate in\nthe endoderm. The epithelium that lines vessels in the lymphatic and cardiovascular system derives from the\nmesoderm and is called an endothelium.\nAll epithelia share some important structural and functional features. This tissue is highly cellular, with little or no\nextracellular material present between cells. Adjoining cells form a specialized intercellular connection between\ntheir cell membranes called a cell junction.', 'Epithelial Membranes\nThe epithelial membrane is composed of epithelium attached to a layer of connective tissue, for example, your\nskin. The mucous membrane is also a composite of connective and epithelial tissues. Sometimes called mucosae,\nthese epithelial membranes line the body cavities and hollow passageways that open to the external environment,\nand include the digestive, respiratory, excretory, and reproductive tracts. Mucus, produced by the epithelial exocrine\n4.1 • Types of Tissues\n129\nglands, covers the epithelial layer. The underlying connective tissue, called the lamina propria (literally “own\nlayer”), help support the fragile epithelial layer.\nA serous membrane is an epithelial membrane composed of mesodermally derived epithelium called the\nmesothelium that is supported by connective tissue. These membranes line the coelomic cavities of the body, that\nis, those cavities that do not open to the outside, and they cover the organs located within those cavities. They are\nessentially membranous bags, with mesothelium lining the inside and connective tissue on the outside. Serous fluid\nsecreted by the cells of the thin squamous mesothelium lubricates the membrane and reduces abrasion and friction\nbetween organs. Serous membranes are identified according locations. Three serous membranes line the thoracic\ncavity; the two pleura that cover the lungs and the pericardium that covers the heart. A fourth, the peritoneum, is\nthe serous membrane in the abdominal cavity that covers abdominal organs and forms double sheets of\nmesenteries that suspend many of the digestive organs.\nThe skin is an epithelial membrane also called the cutaneous membrane. It is a stratified squamous epithelial\nmembrane resting on top of connective tissue. The apical surface of this membrane is exposed to the external\nenvironment and is covered with dead, keratinized cells that help protect the body from desiccation and pathogens.', 'In simple columnar epithelium, the nucleus of the tall column-like cells tends to be elongated and located in the\nbasal end of the cells. Like the cuboidal epithelia, this epithelium is active in the absorption and secretion of\nmolecules. Simple columnar epithelium forms the lining of some sections of the digestive system and parts of the\nfemale reproductive tract. Ciliated columnar epithelium is composed of simple columnar epithelial cells with cilia on\ntheir apical surfaces. These epithelial cells are found in the lining of the fallopian tubes and parts of the respiratory\nsystem, where the beating of the cilia helps remove particulate matter.\nPseudostratified columnar epithelium is a type of epithelium that appears to be stratified but instead consists of a\nsingle layer of irregularly shaped and differently sized columnar cells. In pseudostratified epithelium, nuclei of\nneighboring cells appear at different levels rather than clustered in the basal end. The arrangement gives the\nappearance of stratification; but in fact all the cells are in contact with the basal lamina, although some do not reach\nthe apical surface. Pseudostratified columnar epithelium is found in the respiratory tract, where some of these cells\nhave cilia.\nBoth simple and pseudostratified columnar epithelia are heterogeneous epithelia because they include additional\ntypes of cells interspersed among the epithelial cells. For example, a goblet cell is a mucous-secreting unicellular\n“gland” interspersed between the columnar epithelial cells of mucous membranes (Figure 4.7).\n134\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 4.7\nGoblet Cell\n(a) In the lining of the small intestine, columnar epithelium cells are interspersed with goblet cells.

What is the process by which the DNA code is converted into an RNA code?,"['For example, the DNA triplet CAC (cytosine, adenine, and cytosine) specifies the\namino acid valine. Therefore, a gene, which is composed of multiple triplets in a unique sequence, provides the code\nto build an entire protein, with multiple amino acids in the proper sequence (Figure 3.25). The mechanism by which\ncells turn the DNA code into a protein product is a two-step process, with an RNA molecule as the intermediate.\nFIGURE 3.25\nThe Genetic Code\nDNA holds all of the genetic information necessary to build a cell’s proteins. The nucleotide sequence\nof a gene is ultimately translated into an amino acid sequence of the gene’s corresponding protein.\nFrom DNA to RNA: Transcription\nDNA is housed within the nucleus, and protein synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm, thus there must be some sort\nof intermediate messenger that leaves the nucleus and manages protein synthesis. This intermediate messenger is\nmessenger RNA (mRNA), a single-stranded nucleic acid that carries a copy of the genetic code for a single gene out\nof the nucleus and into the cytoplasm where it is used to produce proteins.\nThere are several different types of RNA, each having different functions in the cell. The structure of RNA is similar\nto DNA with a few small exceptions. For one thing, unlike DNA, most types of RNA, including mRNA, are single-\nstranded and contain no complementary strand. Second, the ribose sugar in RNA contains an additional oxygen\n3.4 • Protein Synthesis\n103\natom compared with DNA. Finally, instead of the base thymine, RNA contains the base uracil. This means that\nadenine will always pair up with uracil during the protein synthesis process.\nGene expression begins with the process called transcription, which is the synthesis of a strand of mRNA that is\ncomplementary to the gene of interest. This process is called transcription because the mRNA is like a transcript, or\ncopy, of the gene’s DNA code. Transcription begins in a fashion somewhat like DNA replication, in that a region of\nDNA unwinds and the two strands separate, however, only that small portion of the DNA will be split apart. The\ntriplets within the gene on this section of the DNA molecule are used as the template to transcribe the\ncomplementary strand of RNA (Figure 3.26).', 'In the first step,\ntranscription, the DNA code is converted into an RNA\ncode. A molecule of messenger RNA that is\ncomplementary to a specific gene is synthesized in a\nprocess similar to DNA replication. The molecule of\nmRNA provides the code to synthesize a protein. In the\nprocess of translation, the mRNA attaches to a\nribosome. Next, tRNA molecules shuttle the\nappropriate amino acids to the ribosome, one-by-one,\ncoded by sequential triplet codons on the mRNA, until\nthe protein is fully synthesized. When completed, the\nmRNA detaches from the ribosome, and the protein is\nreleased. Typically, multiple ribosomes attach to a\nsingle mRNA molecule at once such that multiple\nproteins can be manufactured from the mRNA\nconcurrently.\n3 • Chapter Review\n119\n3.5 Cell Growth and Division\nThe life of cell consists of stages that make up the cell\ncycle. After a cell is born, it passes through an\ninterphase before it is ready to replicate itself and\nproduce daughter cells. This interphase includes two\ngap phases (G1 and G2), as well as an S phase, during\nwhich its DNA is replicated in preparation for cell\ndivision. The cell cycle is under precise regulation by\nchemical messengers both inside and outside the cell\nthat provide “stop” and “go” signals for movement\nfrom one phase to the next. Failures of these signals\ncan result in cells that continue to divide\nuncontrollably, which can lead to cancer.\nOnce a cell has completed interphase and is ready for\ncell division, it proceeds through four separate stages\nof mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and\ntelophase). Telophase is followed by the division of the\ncytoplasm (cytokinesis), which generates two daughter\ncells. This process takes place in all normally dividing\ncells of the body except for the germ cells that produce\neggs and sperm.\n3.6 Cellular Differentiation\nOne of the major areas of research in biology is that of\nhow cells specialize to assume their unique structures\nand functions, since all cells essentially originate from\na single fertilized egg. Cell differentiation is the process\nof cells becoming specialized as they body develops.', 'This process is called transcription because the mRNA is like a transcript, or\ncopy, of the gene’s DNA code. Transcription begins in a fashion somewhat like DNA replication, in that a region of\nDNA unwinds and the two strands separate, however, only that small portion of the DNA will be split apart. The\ntriplets within the gene on this section of the DNA molecule are used as the template to transcribe the\ncomplementary strand of RNA (Figure 3.26). A codon is a three-base sequence of mRNA, so-called because they\ndirectly encode amino acids. Like DNA replication, there are three stages to transcription: initiation, elongation, and\ntermination.\nFIGURE 3.26\nTranscription: from DNA to mRNA\nIn the first of the two stages of making protein from DNA, a gene on the DNA\nmolecule is transcribed into a complementary mRNA molecule.\nStage 1: Initiation. A region at the beginning of the gene called a promoter—a particular sequence of\nnucleotides—triggers the start of transcription.\nStage 2: Elongation. Transcription starts when RNA polymerase unwinds the DNA segment. One strand, referred to\nas the coding strand, becomes the template with the genes to be coded. The polymerase then aligns the correct\nnucleic acid (A, C, G, or U) with its complementary base on the coding strand of DNA. RNA polymerase is an enzyme\nthat adds new nucleotides to a growing strand of RNA. This process builds a strand of mRNA.\nStage 3: Termination. At the end of the gene, a sequence of nucleotides called the terminator sequence causes the\nnew RNA to fold up on itself. This fold causes the RNA to separate from the gene and from RNA polymerase, ending\ntranscription.\nBefore the mRNA molecule leaves the nucleus and proceeds to protein synthesis, it is modified in a number of ways.\nFor this reason, it is often called a pre-mRNA at this stage. For example, your DNA, and thus complementary mRNA,\ncontains long regions called non-coding regions that do not code for amino acids. Their function is still a mystery,\nbut the process called splicing removes these non-coding regions from the pre-mRNA transcript (Figure 3.27).', 'This nuclear envelope is studded with protein-\nlined pores that allow materials to be trafficked into\nand out of the nucleus. The nucleus contains one or\nmore nucleoli, which serve as sites for ribosome\nsynthesis. The nucleus houses the genetic material of\nthe cell: DNA.

When a cell is about to\ndivide, the chromatin coils tightly and condenses to\nform chromosomes.\nThere is a pool of cells constantly dividing within your\nbody. The result is billions of new cells being created\neach day. Before any cell is ready to divide, it must\nreplicate its DNA so that each new daughter cell will\nreceive an exact copy of the organism’s genome. A\nvariety of enzymes are enlisted during DNA replication.\nThese enzymes unwind the DNA molecule, separate\nthe two strands, and assist with the building of\ncomplementary strands along each parent strand. The\noriginal DNA strands serve as templates from which\nthe nucleotide sequence of the new strands are\ndetermined and synthesized. When replication is\ncompleted, two identical DNA molecules exist. Each\none contains one original strand and one newly\nsynthesized complementary strand.\n3.4 Protein Synthesis\nDNA stores the information necessary for instructing\nthe cell to perform all of its functions. Cells use the\ngenetic code stored within DNA to build proteins,\nwhich ultimately determine the structure and function\nof the cell. This genetic code lies in the particular\nsequence of nucleotides that make up each gene along\nthe DNA molecule. To “read” this code, the cell must\nperform two sequential steps. In the first step,\ntranscription, the DNA code is converted into an RNA\ncode.

For example, your DNA, and thus complementary mRNA,\ncontains long regions called non-coding regions that do not code for amino acids. Their function is still a mystery,\nbut the process called splicing removes these non-coding regions from the pre-mRNA transcript (Figure 3.27). A\nspliceosome—a structure composed of various proteins and other molecules—attaches to the mRNA and “splices”\nor cuts out the non-coding regions. The removed segment of the transcript is called an intron. The remaining exons\nare pasted together. An exon is a segment of RNA that remains after splicing. Interestingly, some introns that are\nremoved from mRNA are not always non-coding. When different coding regions of mRNA are spliced out, different\nvariations of the protein will eventually result, with differences in structure and function. This process results in a\nmuch larger variety of possible proteins and protein functions. When the mRNA transcript is ready, it travels out of\nthe nucleus and into the cytoplasm.\n104\n3 • The Cellular Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 3.27\nSplicing DNA\nIn the nucleus, a structure called a spliceosome cuts out introns (noncoding regions) within a pre-mRNA\ntranscript and reconnects the exons.\nFrom RNA to Protein: Translation\nLike translating a book from one language into another, the codons on a strand of mRNA must be translated into the\namino acid alphabet of proteins. Translation is the process of synthesizing a chain of amino acids called a\npolypeptide.

Where do tRNA molecules shuttle the appropriate amino acids to during protein synthesis?,"['On the other end is a base sequence that\nmatches the codon specifying its particular amino acid. This sequence of three bases on the tRNA molecule is called\nan anticodon. For example, a tRNA responsible for shuttling the amino acid glycine contains a binding site for\nglycine on one end. On the other end it contains an anticodon that complements the glycine codon (GGA is a codon\nfor glycine, and so the tRNAs anticodon would read CCU). Equipped with its particular cargo and matching\nanticodon, a tRNA molecule can read its recognized mRNA codon and bring the corresponding amino acid to the\ngrowing chain (Figure 3.28).\n3.4 • Protein Synthesis\n105\nFIGURE 3.28\nTranslation from RNA to Protein\nDuring translation, the mRNA transcript is “read” by a functional complex consisting of\nthe ribosome and tRNA molecules. tRNAs bring the appropriate amino acids in sequence to the growing polypeptide chain by matching\ntheir anti-codons with codons on the mRNA strand.\nMuch like the processes of DNA replication and transcription, translation consists of three main stages: initiation,\nelongation, and termination. Initiation takes place with the binding of a ribosome to an mRNA transcript. The\nelongation stage involves the recognition of a tRNA anticodon with the next mRNA codon in the sequence. Once the\nanticodon and codon sequences are bound (remember, they are complementary base pairs), the tRNA presents its\namino acid cargo and the growing polypeptide strand is attached to this next amino acid. This attachment takes\nplace with the assistance of various enzymes and requires energy. The tRNA molecule then releases the mRNA\nstrand, the mRNA strand shifts one codon over in the ribosome, and the next appropriate tRNA arrives with its\nmatching anticodon. This process continues until the final codon on the mRNA is reached which provides a “stop”\nmessage that signals termination of translation and triggers the release of the complete, newly synthesized protein.\nThus, a gene within the DNA molecule is transcribed into mRNA, which is then translated into a protein product\n(Figure 3.29).', 'Translation is the process of synthesizing a chain of amino acids called a\npolypeptide. Translation requires two major aids: first, a “translator,” the molecule that will conduct the translation,\nand second, a substrate on which the mRNA strand is translated into a new protein, like the translator’s “desk.” Both\nof these requirements are fulfilled by other types of RNA. The substrate on which translation takes place is the\nribosome.\nRemember that many of a cell’s ribosomes are found associated with the rough ER, and carry out the synthesis of\nproteins destined for the Golgi apparatus. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a type of RNA that, together with proteins,\ncomposes the structure of the ribosome. Ribosomes exist in the cytoplasm as two distinct components, a small and\na large subunit. When an mRNA molecule is ready to be translated, the two subunits come together and attach to\nthe mRNA. The ribosome provides a substrate for translation, bringing together and aligning the mRNA molecule\nwith the molecular “translators” that must decipher its code.\nThe other major requirement for protein synthesis is the translator molecules that physically “read” the mRNA\ncodons. Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a type of RNA that ferries the appropriate corresponding amino acids to the\nribosome, and attaches each new amino acid to the last, building the polypeptide chain one-by-one. Thus tRNA\ntransfers specific amino acids from the cytoplasm to a growing polypeptide. The tRNA molecules must be able to\nrecognize the codons on mRNA and match them with the correct amino acid. The tRNA is modified for this function.\nOn one end of its structure is a binding site for a specific amino acid. On the other end is a base sequence that\nmatches the codon specifying its particular amino acid. This sequence of three bases on the tRNA molecule is called\nan anticodon. For example, a tRNA responsible for shuttling the amino acid glycine contains a binding site for\nglycine on one end.

The nucleus contains one or\nmore nucleoli, which serve as sites for ribosome\nsynthesis. The nucleus houses the genetic material of\nthe cell: DNA. DNA is normally found as a loosely\ncontained structure called chromatin within the\nnucleus, where it is wound up and associated with a\nvariety of histone proteins. When a cell is about to\ndivide, the chromatin coils tightly and condenses to\nform chromosomes.\nThere is a pool of cells constantly dividing within your\nbody. The result is billions of new cells being created\neach day. Before any cell is ready to divide, it must\nreplicate its DNA so that each new daughter cell will\nreceive an exact copy of the organism’s genome. A\nvariety of enzymes are enlisted during DNA replication.\nThese enzymes unwind the DNA molecule, separate\nthe two strands, and assist with the building of\ncomplementary strands along each parent strand. The\noriginal DNA strands serve as templates from which\nthe nucleotide sequence of the new strands are\ndetermined and synthesized. When replication is\ncompleted, two identical DNA molecules exist. Each\none contains one original strand and one newly\nsynthesized complementary strand.\n3.4 Protein Synthesis\nDNA stores the information necessary for instructing\nthe cell to perform all of its functions. Cells use the\ngenetic code stored within DNA to build proteins,\nwhich ultimately determine the structure and function\nof the cell. This genetic code lies in the particular\nsequence of nucleotides that make up each gene along\nthe DNA molecule. To “read” this code, the cell must\nperform two sequential steps. In the first step,\ntranscription, the DNA code is converted into an RNA\ncode. A molecule of messenger RNA that is\ncomplementary to a specific gene is synthesized in a\nprocess similar to DNA replication. The molecule of\nmRNA provides the code to synthesize a protein. In the\nprocess of translation, the mRNA attaches to a\nribosome. Next, tRNA molecules shuttle the\nappropriate amino acids to the ribosome, one-by-one,\ncoded by sequential triplet codons on the mRNA, until\nthe protein is fully synthesized.', 'In the first step,\ntranscription, the DNA code is converted into an RNA\ncode.

Typically, multiple ribosomes attach to a\nsingle mRNA molecule at once such that multiple\nproteins can be manufactured from the mRNA\nconcurrently.\n3 • Chapter Review\n119\n3.5 Cell Growth and Division\nThe life of cell consists of stages that make up the cell\ncycle. After a cell is born, it passes through an\ninterphase before it is ready to replicate itself and\nproduce daughter cells. This interphase includes two\ngap phases (G1 and G2), as well as an S phase, during\nwhich its DNA is replicated in preparation for cell\ndivision. The cell cycle is under precise regulation by\nchemical messengers both inside and outside the cell\nthat provide “stop” and “go” signals for movement\nfrom one phase to the next. Failures of these signals\ncan result in cells that continue to divide\nuncontrollably, which can lead to cancer.\nOnce a cell has completed interphase and is ready for\ncell division, it proceeds through four separate stages\nof mitosis (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and\ntelophase). Telophase is followed by the division of the\ncytoplasm (cytokinesis), which generates two daughter\ncells. This process takes place in all normally dividing\ncells of the body except for the germ cells that produce\neggs and sperm.\n3.6 Cellular Differentiation\nOne of the major areas of research in biology is that of\nhow cells specialize to assume their unique structures\nand functions, since all cells essentially originate from\na single fertilized egg. Cell differentiation is the process\nof cells becoming specialized as they body develops.', 'This refers to the fact\nthat DNA contains the information necessary for the cell to build one very important type of molecule: the protein.\nMost structural components of the cell are made up, at least in part, by proteins and virtually all the functions that a\ncell carries out are completed with the help of proteins. One of the most important classes of proteins is enzymes,\nwhich help speed up necessary biochemical reactions that take place inside the cell. Some of these critical\nbiochemical reactions include building larger molecules from smaller components (such as occurs during DNA\nreplication or synthesis of microtubules) and breaking down larger molecules into smaller components (such as\nwhen harvesting chemical energy from nutrient molecules). Whatever the cellular process may be, it is almost sure\nto involve proteins. Just as the cell’s genome describes its full complement of DNA, a cell’s proteome is its full\ncomplement of proteins. Protein synthesis begins with genes. A gene is a functional segment of DNA that provides\nthe genetic information necessary to build a protein. Each particular gene provides the code necessary to construct\na particular protein. Gene expression, which transforms the information coded in a gene to a final gene product,\nultimately dictates the structure and function of a cell by determining which proteins are made.\nThe interpretation of genes works in the following way. Recall that proteins are polymers, or chains, of many amino\nacid building blocks. The sequence of bases in a gene (that is, its sequence of A, T, C, G nucleotides) translates to an\namino acid sequence. A triplet is a section of three DNA bases in a row that codes for a specific amino acid. Similar\nto the way in which the three-letter code d-o-g signals the image of a dog, the three-letter DNA base code signals\nthe use of a particular amino acid. For example, the DNA triplet CAC (cytosine, adenine, and cytosine) specifies the\namino acid valine. Therefore, a gene, which is composed of multiple triplets in a unique sequence, provides the code\nto build an entire protein, with multiple amino acids in the proper sequence (Figure 3.25). The mechanism by which\ncells turn the DNA code into a protein product is a two-step process, with an RNA molecule as the intermediate.']",tRNA molecules shuttle the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis.,tRNA molecules shuttle the appropriate amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis.

The cells within a tissue share a\ncommon embryonic origin. Microscopic observation reveals that the cells in a tissue share morphological features\nand are arranged in an orderly pattern that achieves the tissue’s functions. From the evolutionary perspective,\ntissues appear in more complex organisms. For example, multicellular protists, ancient eukaryotes, do not have\ncells organized into tissues.\nAlthough there are many types of cells in the human body, they are organized into four broad categories of tissues:\nepithelial, connective, muscle, and nervous. Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands.', ""The Levels of Organization\nTo study the chemical level of organization, scientists consider the simplest building blocks of matter: subatomic\nparticles, atoms and molecules. All matter in the universe is composed of one or more unique pure substances\ncalled elements, familiar examples of which are hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, calcium, and iron. The smallest\nunit of any of these pure substances (elements) is an atom. Atoms are made up of subatomic particles such as the\nproton, electron and neutron. Two or more atoms combine to form a molecule, such as the water molecules,\nproteins, and sugars found in living things. Molecules are the chemical building blocks of all body structures.\nA cell is the smallest independently functioning unit of a living organism. Even bacteria, which are extremely small,\nindependently-living organisms, have a cellular structure. Each bacterium is a single cell. All living structures of\nhuman anatomy contain cells, and almost all functions of human physiology are performed in cells or are initiated by\ncells.\n10\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nA human cell typically consists of flexible membranes that enclose cytoplasm, a water-based cellular fluid together\nwith a variety of tiny functioning units called organelles. In humans, as in all organisms, cells perform all functions\nof life. A tissue is a group of many similar cells (though sometimes composed of a few related types) that work\ntogether to perform a specific function. An organ is an anatomically distinct structure of the body composed of two\nor more tissue types. Each organ performs one or more specific physiological functions. An organ system is a group\nof organs that work together to perform major functions or meet physiological needs of the body.\nThis book covers eleven distinct organ systems in the human body (Figure 1.4 and Figure 1.5). Assigning organs to\norgan systems can be imprecise since organs that “belong” to one system can also have functions integral to\nanother system. In fact, most organs contribute to more than one system.\nIn this book and throughout your studies of biological sciences, you will often read descriptions related to\nsimilarities and differences among biological structures, processes, and health related to a person's biological sex."", 'These different cell types form specialized\ntissues that work in concert to perform all of the functions necessary for the living organism. Cellular and\ndevelopmental biologists study how the continued division of a single cell leads to such complexity and\ndifferentiation.\nConsider the difference between a structural cell in the skin and a nerve cell. A structural skin cell may be shaped\nlike a flat plate (squamous) and live only for a short time before it is shed and replaced. Packed tightly into rows and\nsheets, the squamous skin cells provide a protective barrier for the cells and tissues that lie beneath. A nerve cell,\non the other hand, may be shaped something like a star, sending out long processes up to a meter in length and may\nlive for the entire lifetime of the organism. With their long winding appendages, nerve cells can communicate with\none another and with other types of body cells and send rapid signals that inform the organism about its\nenvironment and allow it to interact with that environment. These differences illustrate one very important theme\nthat is consistent at all organizational levels of biology: the form of a structure is optimally suited to perform\nparticular functions assigned to that structure. Keep this theme in mind as you tour the inside of a cell and are\nFigure 3.1\nFluorescence-stained Cell Undergoing Mitosis A lung cell from a newt, commonly studied for its similarity to human lung\ncells, is stained with fluorescent dyes.

Cells lining the airways and most of the digestive system originate in\nthe endoderm. The epithelium that lines vessels in the lymphatic and cardiovascular system derives from the\nmesoderm and is called an endothelium.\nAll epithelia share some important structural and functional features. This tissue is highly cellular, with little or no\nextracellular material present between cells. Adjoining cells form a specialized intercellular connection between\ntheir cell membranes called a cell junction. The epithelial cells exhibit polarity with differences in structure and\nfunction between the exposed or apical facing surface of the cell and the basal surface close to the underlying body\nstructures. The basal lamina, a mixture of glycoproteins and collagen, provides an attachment site for the\nepithelium, separating it from underlying connective tissue. The basal lamina attaches to a reticular lamina, which\nis secreted by the underlying connective tissue, forming a basement membrane that helps hold it all together.\nEpithelial tissues are nearly completely avascular. For instance, no blood vessels cross the basement membrane to\nenter the tissue, and nutrients must come by diffusion or absorption from underlying tissues or the surface. Many\nepithelial tissues are capable of rapidly replacing damaged and dead cells. Sloughing off of damaged or dead cells is\na characteristic of surface epithelium and allows our airways and digestive tracts to rapidly replace damaged cells\nwith new cells.\nGeneralized Functions of Epithelial Tissue\nEpithelial tissues provide the body’s first line of protection from physical, chemical, and biological wear and tear.\nThe cells of an epithelium act as gatekeepers of the body controlling permeability and allowing selective transfer of\nmaterials across a physical barrier.

A glandular epithelium contains\nmany secretory cells.\nThe Epithelial Cell\nEpithelial cells are typically characterized by the polarized distribution of organelles and membrane-bound proteins\nbetween their basal and apical surfaces. Particular structures found in some epithelial cells are an adaptation to\nspecific functions. Certain organelles are segregated to the basal sides, whereas other organelles and extensions,\nsuch as cilia, when present, are on the apical surface.\nCilia are microscopic extensions of the apical cell membrane that are supported by microtubules. They beat in\nunison and move fluids as well as trapped particles. Ciliated epithelium lines the ventricles of the brain where it\nhelps circulate the cerebrospinal fluid. The ciliated epithelium of your airway forms a mucociliary escalator that\nsweeps particles of dust and pathogens trapped in the secreted mucous toward the throat. It is called an escalator\nbecause it continuously pushes mucous with trapped particles upward. In contrast, nasal cilia sweep the mucous\nblanket down towards your throat. In both cases, the transported materials are usually swallowed, and end up in the\nacidic environment of your stomach.\nCell to Cell Junctions\nCells of epithelia are closely connected and are not separated by intracellular material.

This enables the epithelia to\nact as selective barriers. An anchoring junction includes several types of cell junctions that help stabilize epithelial\ntissues. Anchoring junctions are common on the lateral and basal surfaces of cells where they provide strong and\nflexible connections. There are three types of anchoring junctions: desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, and adherens.\nDesmosomes occur in patches on the membranes of cells. The patches are structural proteins on the inner surface\nof the cell’s membrane. The adhesion molecule, cadherin, is embedded in these patches and projects through the\ncell membrane to link with the cadherin molecules of adjacent cells. These connections are especially important in\nholding cells together. Hemidesmosomes, which look like half a desmosome, link cells to the extracellular matrix,\nfor example, the basal lamina. While similar in appearance to desmosomes, they include the adhesion proteins\ncalled integrins rather than cadherins. Adherens junctions use either cadherins or integrins depending on whether\nthey are linking to other cells or matrix. The junctions are characterized by the presence of the contractile protein\nactin located on the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. The actin can connect isolated patches or form a\nbelt-like structure inside the cell. These junctions influence the shape and folding of the epithelial tissue.', 'All substances that enter the body must cross an epithelium. Some epithelia\n130\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\noften include structural features that allow the selective transport of molecules and ions across their cell\nmembranes.\nMany epithelial cells are capable of secretion and release mucous and specific chemical compounds onto their\napical surfaces. The epithelium of the small intestine releases digestive enzymes, for example. Cells lining the\nrespiratory tract secrete mucous that traps incoming microorganisms and particles. A glandular epithelium contains\nmany secretory cells.\nThe Epithelial Cell\nEpithelial cells are typically characterized by the polarized distribution of organelles and membrane-bound proteins\nbetween their basal and apical surfaces. Particular structures found in some epithelial cells are an adaptation to\nspecific functions. Certain organelles are segregated to the basal sides, whereas other organelles and extensions,\nsuch as cilia, when present, are on the apical surface.\nCilia are microscopic extensions of the apical cell membrane that are supported by microtubules. They beat in\nunison and move fluids as well as trapped particles. Ciliated epithelium lines the ventricles of the brain where it\nhelps circulate the cerebrospinal fluid. The ciliated epithelium of your airway forms a mucociliary escalator that\nsweeps particles of dust and pathogens trapped in the secreted mucous toward the throat. It is called an escalator\nbecause it continuously pushes mucous with trapped particles upward. In contrast, nasal cilia sweep the mucous\nblanket down towards your throat. In both cases, the transported materials are usually swallowed, and end up in the\nacidic environment of your stomach.\nCell to Cell Junctions\nCells of epithelia are closely connected and are not separated by intracellular material.

These junctions allow electrical and metabolic coupling of adjacent cells, which coordinates function\nin large groups of cells.\nClassification of Epithelial Tissues\nEpithelial tissues are classified according to the shape of the cells and number of the cell layers formed (Figure 4.6).\nCell shapes can be squamous (flattened and thin), cuboidal (boxy, as wide as it is tall), or columnar (rectangular,\ntaller than it is wide). Similarly, the number of cell layers in the tissue can be one—where every cell rests on the\nbasal lamina—which is a simple epithelium, or more than one, which is a stratified epithelium and only the basal\nlayer of cells rests on the basal lamina. Pseudostratified (pseudo- = “false”) describes tissue with a single layer of\nirregularly shaped cells that give the appearance of more than one layer. Transitional describes a form of specialized\nstratified epithelium in which the shape of the cells can vary.\nFIGURE 4.6\nCells of Epithelial Tissue\nSimple epithelial tissue is organized as a single layer of cells and stratified epithelial tissue is\nformed by several layers of cells.\nSimple Epithelium\nThe shape of the cells in the single cell layer of simple epithelium reflects the functioning of those cells.

Epithelium also forms much of the glandular tissue of the body. Skin\nis not the only area of the body exposed to the outside. Other areas include the airways, the digestive tract, as well\nas the urinary and reproductive systems, all of which are lined by an epithelium. Hollow organs and body cavities\nthat do not connect to the exterior of the body, which includes, blood vessels and serous membranes, are lined by\nendothelium (plural = endothelia), which is a type of epithelium.\nEpithelial cells derive from all three major embryonic layers. The epithelia lining the skin, parts of the mouth and\nnose, and the anus develop from the ectoderm. Cells lining the airways and most of the digestive system originate in\nthe endoderm. The epithelium that lines vessels in the lymphatic and cardiovascular system derives from the\nmesoderm and is called an endothelium.\nAll epithelia share some important structural and functional features.

What is the major function of connective tissue?,"['The matrix usually includes a large amount of extracellular\nmaterial produced by the connective tissue cells that are embedded within it. The matrix plays a major role in the\nfunctioning of this tissue. The major component of the matrix is a ground substance often crisscrossed by protein\nfibers. This ground substance is usually a fluid, but it can also be mineralized and solid, as in bones. Connective\ntissues come in a vast variety of forms, yet they typically have in common three characteristic components: cells,\nlarge amounts of amorphous ground substance, and protein fibers. The amount and structure of each component\ncorrelates with the function of the tissue, from the rigid ground substance in bones supporting the body to the\ninclusion of specialized cells; for example, a phagocytic cell that engulfs pathogens and also rids tissue of cellular\ndebris.\nFunctions of Connective Tissues\nConnective tissues perform many functions in the body, but most importantly, they support and connect other\ntissues; from the connective tissue sheath that surrounds muscle cells, to the tendons that attach muscles to bones,\nand to the skeleton that supports the positions of the body. Protection is another major function of connective\ntissue, in the form of fibrous capsules and bones that protect delicate organs and, of course, the skeletal system.\nSpecialized cells in connective tissue defend the body from microorganisms that enter the body. Transport of fluid,\nnutrients, waste, and chemical messengers is ensured by specialized fluid connective tissues, such as blood and\nlymph. Adipose cells store surplus energy in the form of fat and contribute to the thermal insulation of the body.\nEmbryonic Connective Tissue\nAll connective tissues derive from the mesodermal layer of the embryo (see Figure 4.3).

Protein fibers\nfall into three major groups: collagen fibers that are\nthick, strong, flexible, and resist stretch; reticular fibers\nthat are thin and form a supportive mesh; and elastin\nfibers that are thin and elastic.\nThe major types of connective tissue are connective\ntissue proper, supportive tissue, and fluid tissue. Loose\nconnective tissue proper includes adipose tissue,\nareolar tissue, and reticular tissue. These serve to hold\norgans and other tissues in place and, in the case of\nadipose tissue, isolate and store energy reserves. The\nmatrix is the most abundant feature for loose tissue\nalthough adipose tissue does not have much\nextracellular matrix.

(Micrographs provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)\nBone\nBone is the hardest connective tissue. It provides protection to internal organs and supports the body. Bone’s rigid\nextracellular matrix contains mostly collagen fibers embedded in a mineralized ground substance containing\nhydroxyapatite, a form of calcium phosphate. Both components of the matrix, organic and inorganic, contribute to\nthe unusual properties of bone. Without collagen, bones would be brittle and shatter easily. Without mineral\ncrystals, bones would flex and provide little support. Osteocytes, bone cells like chondrocytes, are located within\nlacunae. The histology of transverse tissue from long bone shows a typical arrangement of osteocytes in concentric\ncircles around a central canal. Bone is a highly vascularized tissue. Unlike cartilage, bone tissue can recover from\ninjuries in a relatively short time.\nCancellous bone looks like a sponge under the microscope and contains empty spaces between trabeculae, or\narches of bone proper. It is lighter than compact bone and found in the interior of some bones and at the end of long\nbones. Compact bone is solid and has greater structural strength.', 'Collagen fibers, while\nflexible, have great tensile strength, resist stretching, and give ligaments and tendons their characteristic resilience\nand strength. These fibers hold connective tissues together, even during the movement of the body.\nElastic fiber contains the protein elastin along with lesser amounts of other proteins and glycoproteins. The main\nproperty of elastin is that after being stretched or compressed, it will return to its original shape. Elastic fibers are\nprominent in elastic tissues found in skin and the elastic ligaments of the vertebral column.\nReticular fiber is also formed from the same protein subunits as collagen fibers; however, these fibers remain\nnarrow and are arrayed in a branching network. They are found throughout the body, but are most abundant in the\nreticular tissue of soft organs, such as liver and spleen, where they anchor and provide structural support to the\nparenchyma (the functional cells, blood vessels, and nerves of the organ).\nAll of these fiber types are embedded in ground substance. Secreted by fibroblasts, ground substance is made of\npolysaccharides, specifically hyaluronic acid, and proteins. These combine to form a proteoglycan with a protein\ncore and polysaccharide branches. The proteoglycan attracts and traps available moisture forming the clear,\nviscous, colorless matrix you now know as ground substance.\nLoose Connective Tissue\nLoose connective tissue is found between many organs where it acts both to absorb shock and bind tissues\ntogether. It allows water, salts, and various nutrients to diffuse through to adjacent or imbedded cells and tissues.\nAdipose tissue consists mostly of fat storage cells, with little extracellular matrix (Figure 4.13). A large number of\ncapillaries allow rapid storage and mobilization of lipid molecules. White adipose tissue is most abundant. It can\nappear yellow and owes its color to carotene and related pigments from plant food.

Both serous and mucous glands are common in the salivary glands of the mouth.\nMixed exocrine glands contain both serous and mucous glands and release both types of secretions.\n4.3 Connective Tissue Supports and Protects\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nIdentify and distinguish between the types of connective tissue: proper, supportive, and fluid\n•\nExplain the functions of connective tissues\nAs may be obvious from its name, one of the major functions of connective tissue is to connect tissues and organs.\nUnlike epithelial tissue, which is composed of cells closely packed with little or no extracellular space in between,\nconnective tissue cells are dispersed in a matrix. The matrix usually includes a large amount of extracellular\nmaterial produced by the connective tissue cells that are embedded within it. The matrix plays a major role in the\nfunctioning of this tissue. The major component of the matrix is a ground substance often crisscrossed by protein\nfibers. This ground substance is usually a fluid, but it can also be mineralized and solid, as in bones. Connective\ntissues come in a vast variety of forms, yet they typically have in common three characteristic components: cells,\nlarge amounts of amorphous ground substance, and protein fibers.', 'Collagen fibers, while\nflexible, have great tensile strength, resist stretching, and give ligaments and tendons their characteristic resilience\nand strength. These fibers hold connective tissues together, even during the movement of the body.\nElastic fiber contains the protein elastin along with lesser amounts of other proteins and glycoproteins. The main\nproperty of elastin is that after being stretched or compressed, it will return to its original shape. Elastic fibers are\nprominent in elastic tissues found in skin and the elastic ligaments of the vertebral column.\nReticular fiber is also formed from the same protein subunits as collagen fibers; however, these fibers remain\nnarrow and are arrayed in a branching network. They are found throughout the body, but are most abundant in the\nreticular tissue of soft organs, such as liver and spleen, where they anchor and provide structural support to the\nparenchyma (the functional cells, blood vessels, and nerves of the organ).\nAll of these fiber types are embedded in ground substance. Secreted by fibroblasts, ground substance is made of\npolysaccharides, specifically hyaluronic acid, and proteins. These combine to form a proteoglycan with a protein\ncore and polysaccharide branches. The proteoglycan attracts and traps available moisture forming the clear,\nviscous, colorless matrix you now know as ground substance.\nLoose Connective Tissue\nLoose connective tissue is found between many organs where it acts both to absorb shock and bind tissues\ntogether. It allows water, salts, and various nutrients to diffuse through to adjacent or imbedded cells and tissues.\nAdipose tissue consists mostly of fat storage cells, with little extracellular matrix (Figure 4.13). A large number of\ncapillaries allow rapid storage and mobilization of lipid molecules. White adipose tissue is most abundant. It can\nappear yellow and owes its color to carotene and related pigments from plant food. White fat contributes mostly to\nlipid storage and can serve as insulation from cold temperatures and mechanical injuries. White adipose tissue can\n142\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nbe found protecting the kidneys and cushioning the back of the eye.', 'The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream. Glands are classified both according to the\ntype of secretion and by their structure. Merocrine\nglands secrete products as they are synthesized.\nApocrine glands release secretions by pinching off the\napical portion of the cell, whereas holocrine gland cells\nstore their secretions until they rupture and release\ntheir contents. In this case, the cell becomes part of\nthe secretion.\n4.3 Connective Tissue Supports and\nProtects\nConnective tissue is a heterogeneous tissue with many\ncell shapes and tissue architecture. Structurally, all\nconnective tissues contain cells that are embedded in\nan extracellular matrix stabilized by proteins. The\nchemical nature and physical layout of the extracellular\nmatrix and proteins vary enormously among tissues,\nreflecting the variety of functions that connective\ntissue fulfills in the body. Connective tissues separate\nand cushion organs, protecting them from shifting or\ntraumatic injury. Connect tissues provide support and\nassist movement, store and transport energy\nmolecules, protect against infections, and contribute to\ntemperature homeostasis.\nMany different cells contribute to the formation of\nconnective tissues. They originate in the mesodermal\ngerm layer and differentiate from mesenchyme and\nhematopoietic tissue in the bone marrow.

What is dense irregular elastic tissue?,"['Reticular tissue is a mesh-like, supportive framework for soft organs such as lymphatic tissue, the spleen, and the\nliver (Figure 4.14). Reticular cells produce the reticular fibers that form the network onto which other cells attach. It\nderives its name from the Latin reticulus, which means “little net.”\nFIGURE 4.14\nReticular Tissue\nThis is a loose connective tissue made up of a network of reticular fibers that provides a supportive\nframework for soft organs. LM × 1600. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)\nDense Connective Tissue\nDense connective tissue contains more collagen fibers than does loose connective tissue. As a consequence, it\ndisplays greater resistance to stretching. There are two major categories of dense connective tissue: regular and\nirregular. Dense regular connective tissue fibers are parallel to each other, enhancing tensile strength and resistance\nto stretching in the direction of the fiber orientations. Ligaments and tendons are made of dense regular connective\ntissue, but in ligaments not all fibers are parallel. Dense regular elastic tissue contains elastin fibers in addition to\ncollagen fibers, which allows the ligament to return to its original length after stretching. The ligaments in the vocal\nfolds and between the vertebrae in the vertebral column are elastic.\nIn dense irregular connective tissue, the direction of fibers is random. This arrangement gives the tissue greater\nstrength in all directions and less strength in one particular direction. In some tissues, fibers crisscross and form a\nmesh. In other tissues, stretching in several directions is achieved by alternating layers where fibers run in the same\n4.3 • Connective Tissue Supports and Protects\n143\norientation in each layer, and it is the layers themselves that are stacked at an angle.

As you toss the ball high in the air, a burning pain shoots across your wrist and you drop the\ntennis racket. That dull ache in the wrist that you ignored through the summer is now an unbearable pain. The\ngame is over for now.\nAfter examining your swollen wrist, the doctor in the emergency room announces that you have developed wrist\ntendinitis. She recommends icing the tender area, taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication to ease\nthe pain and to reduce swelling, and complete rest for a few weeks. She interrupts your protests that you cannot\nstop playing. She issues a stern warning about the risk of aggravating the condition and the possibility of surgery.\nShe consoles you by mentioning that well known tennis players such as Venus and Serena Williams and Rafael\nNadal have also suffered from tendinitis related injuries.\nWhat is tendinitis and how did it happen? Tendinitis is the inflammation of a tendon, the thick band of fibrous\nconnective tissue that attaches a muscle to a bone. The condition causes pain and tenderness in the area\naround a joint. On rare occasions, a sudden serious injury will cause tendinitis. Most often, the condition results\nfrom repetitive motions over time that strain the tendons needed to perform the tasks.\nPersons whose jobs and hobbies involve performing the same movements over and over again are often at the\ngreatest risk of tendinitis. You hear of tennis and golfer’s elbow, jumper's knee, and swimmer’s shoulder."", 'A layer of dense irregular connective tissue,\nthe perichondrium, encapsulates the cartilage. Cartilaginous tissue is avascular, thus all nutrients need to diffuse\nthrough the matrix to reach the chondrocytes. This is a factor contributing to the very slow healing of cartilaginous\ntissues.\nThe three main types of cartilage tissue are hyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage, and elastic cartilage (Figure 4.16).\nHyaline cartilage, the most common type of cartilage in the body, consists of short and dispersed collagen fibers\nand contains large amounts of proteoglycans. Under the microscope, tissue samples appear clear. The surface of\nhyaline cartilage is smooth. Both strong and flexible, it is found in the rib cage and nose and covers bones where\nthey meet to form moveable joints. It makes up a template of the embryonic skeleton before bone formation. A\nplate of hyaline cartilage at the ends of bone allows continued growth until adulthood. Fibrocartilage is tough\nbecause it has thick bundles of collagen fibers dispersed through its matrix. Menisci in the knee joint and the\nintervertebral discs are examples of fibrocartilage. Elastic cartilage contains elastic fibers as well as collagen and\nproteoglycans. This tissue gives rigid support as well as elasticity. Tug gently at your ear lobes, and notice that the\nlobes return to their initial shape. The external ear contains elastic cartilage.\nWhile older adults are at risk for tendinitis because the elasticity of tendon tissue decreases with age, active\npeople of all ages can develop tendinitis. Young athletes, dancers, and computer operators; anyone who\nperforms the same movements constantly is at risk for tendinitis. Although repetitive motions are unavoidable in\nmany activities and may lead to tendinitis, precautions can be taken that can lessen the probability of\ndeveloping tendinitis. For active individuals, stretches before exercising and cross training or changing exercises\nare recommended. For the passionate athlete, it may be time to take some lessons to improve technique. All of\nthe preventive measures aim to increase the strength of the tendon and decrease the stress put on it. With\nproper rest and managed care, you will be back on the court to hit that slice-spin serve over the net.', 'The first connective tissue\n140\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nto develop in the embryo is mesenchyme, the stem cell line from which all connective tissues are later derived.\nClusters of mesenchymal cells are scattered throughout adult tissue and supply the cells needed for replacement\nand repair after a connective tissue injury. A second type of embryonic connective tissue forms in the umbilical cord,\ncalled mucous connective tissue or Wharton’s jelly. This tissue is no longer present after birth, leaving only\nscattered mesenchymal cells throughout the body.\nClassification of Connective Tissues\nThe three broad categories of connective tissue are classified according to the characteristics of their ground\nsubstance and the types of fibers found within the matrix (Table 4.1). Connective tissue proper includes loose\nconnective tissue and dense connective tissue. Both tissues have a variety of cell types and protein fibers\nsuspended in a viscous ground substance. Dense connective tissue is reinforced by bundles of fibers that provide\ntensile strength, elasticity, and protection. In loose connective tissue, the fibers are loosely organized, leaving large\nspaces in between. Supportive connective tissue—bone and cartilage—provide structure and strength to the body\nand protect soft tissues. A few distinct cell types and densely packed fibers in a matrix characterize these tissues. In\nbone, the matrix is rigid and described as calcified because of the deposited calcium salts. In fluid connective\ntissue, in other words, lymph and blood, various specialized cells circulate in a watery fluid containing salts,\nnutrients, and dissolved proteins.\nConnective Tissue Examples\nConnective tissue proper\nSupportive connective tissue\nFluid connective tissue\nLoose connective tissue\n•\nAreolar\n•\nAdipose\n•\nReticular\nDense connective tissue\n•\nDense regular\n•\nElastic\n•\nDense-irregular\nCartilage\n•\nHyaline\n•\nFibrocartilage\n•\nElastic\nBone\nBlood\nLymph\nTABLE 4.1\nConnective Tissue Proper\nFibroblasts are present in all connective tissue proper (Figure 4.12).', 'They originate in the mesodermal\ngerm layer and differentiate from mesenchyme and\nhematopoietic tissue in the bone marrow.

This tissue is found in structures such as arterial walls, allowing them to maintain their shape after stretching.",Dense irregular elastic tissue gives arterial walls the strength and the ability to regain original shape after stretching.
Where is the dermis of the skin located?,"['The reticular layer appears\nreticulated (net-like) due to a tight meshwork of fibers. Elastin fibers provide some elasticity to the skin, enabling\nmovement. Collagen fibers provide structure and tensile strength, with strands of collagen extending into both the\npapillary layer and the hypodermis. In addition, collagen binds water to keep the skin hydrated. Collagen injections\nand Retin-A creams help restore skin turgor by either introducing collagen externally or stimulating blood flow and\nrepair of the dermis, respectively.\nHypodermis\nThe hypodermis (also called the subcutaneous layer or superficial fascia) is a layer directly below the dermis and\nserves to connect the skin to the underlying fascia (fibrous tissue) of the bones and muscles. It is not strictly a part\nof the skin, although the border between the hypodermis and dermis can be difficult to distinguish. The hypodermis\nconsists of well-vascularized, loose, areolar connective tissue and adipose tissue, which functions as a mode of fat\nstorage and provides insulation and cushioning for the integument.\n168\n5 • The Integumentary System\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nPigmentation\nThe color of skin is influenced by a number of pigments, including melanin, carotene, and hemoglobin. Recall that\nmelanin is produced by cells called melanocytes, which are found scattered throughout the stratum basale of the\nepidermis. The melanin is transferred into the keratinocytes via a cellular vesicle called a melanosome (Figure 5.8).\nEveryday Connection\nLipid Storage\nThe hypodermis is home to most of the fat that concerns people when they are trying to keep their weight under\ncontrol. Adipose tissue present in the hypodermis consists of fat-storing cells called adipocytes. This stored fat\ncan serve as an energy reserve, insulate the body to prevent heat loss, and act as a cushion to protect underlying\nstructures from trauma.\nWhere the fat is deposited and accumulates within the hypodermis depends on hormones (testosterone,\nestrogen, insulin, glucagon, leptin, and others), as well as genetic factors. Fat distribution changes as our bodies\nmature and age.', 'This thin layer of cells is found only in the thick skin of the palms,\nsoles, and digits. The keratinocytes that compose the stratum lucidum are dead and flattened (see Figure 5.5).\nThese cells are densely packed with eleidin, a clear protein, derived from keratohyalin, which gives these cells their\ntransparent (i.e., lucid) appearance.\nStratum Corneum\nThe stratum corneum is the most superficial layer of the epidermis and is the layer exposed to the outside\nenvironment (see Figure 5.5). The increased keratinization (also called cornification) of the cells in this layer gives it\nits name. There are usually 15 to 30 layers of cells in the stratum corneum. This dry, dead layer helps prevent the\npenetration of microbes and the dehydration of underlying tissues, and provides a mechanical protection against\nabrasion for the more delicate, underlying layers. Cells in this layer are shed periodically and are replaced by cells\npushed up from the stratum granulosum (or stratum lucidum in the case of the palms and soles of feet). The entire\nlayer is replaced during a period of about 4 weeks. Cosmetic procedures, such as microdermabrasion, help remove\nsome of the dry, upper layer and aim to keep the skin looking “fresh” and healthy.\nDermis\nThe dermis might be considered the “core” of the integumentary system (derma- = “skin”), as distinct from the\nepidermis (epi- = “upon” or “over”) and hypodermis (hypo- = “below”). It contains blood and lymph vessels, nerves,\nand other structures, such as hair follicles and sweat glands. The dermis is made of two layers of connective tissue\nthat compose an interconnected mesh of elastin and collagenous fibers, produced by fibroblasts (Figure 5.7).\n5.1 • Layers of the Skin\n167\nFIGURE 5.7\nLayers of the Dermis\nThis stained slide shows the two components of the dermis—the papillary layer and the reticular\nlayer.

View this animation (http://openstax.org/l/\nlayers) to learn more about layers of the skin. What are the basic functions of each of these layers?\nThe Epidermis\nThe epidermis is composed of keratinized, stratified squamous epithelium. It is made of four or five layers of\nepithelial cells, depending on its location in the body. It does not have any blood vessels within it (i.e., it is\navascular). Skin that has four layers of cells is referred to as “thin skin.” From deep to superficial, these layers are\nthe stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, and stratum corneum. Most of the skin can be\nclassified as thin skin. “Thick skin” is found only on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. It has a fifth\nlayer, called the stratum lucidum, located between the stratum corneum and the stratum granulosum (Figure 5.3).\nFIGURE 5.3\nThin Skin versus Thick Skin\nThese slides show cross-sections of the epidermis and dermis of (a) thin and (b) thick skin.\nNote the significant difference in the thickness of the epithelial layer of the thick skin. From top, LM × 40, LM × 40. (Micrographs provided by\nthe Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)\nThe cells in all of the layers except the stratum basale are called keratinocytes. A keratinocyte is a cell that\nmanufactures and stores the protein keratin.', 'The cells in the stratum basale bond to the\ndermis via intertwining collagen fibers, referred to as the basement membrane. A finger-like projection, or fold,\nknown as the dermal papilla (plural = dermal papillae) is found in the superficial portion of the dermis. Dermal\npapillae increase the strength of the connection between the epidermis and dermis; the greater the folding, the\nstronger the connections made (Figure 5.5).\nFIGURE 5.5\nLayers of the Epidermis\nThe epidermis of thick skin has five layers: stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum\ngranulosum, stratum lucidum, and stratum corneum.\nThe stratum basale is a single layer of cells primarily made of basal cells.

All of the keratinocytes are produced from this single layer\nof cells, which are constantly going through mitosis to produce new cells. As new cells are formed, the existing cells\nare pushed superficially away from the stratum basale. Two other cell types are found dispersed among the basal\ncells in the stratum basale. The first is a Merkel cell, which functions as a receptor and is responsible for stimulating\nsensory nerves that the brain perceives as touch. These cells are especially abundant on the surfaces of the hands\nand feet. The second is a melanocyte, a cell that produces the pigment melanin. Melanin gives hair and skin its\ncolor, and also helps protect the living cells of the epidermis from ultraviolet (UV) radiation damage.\nIn a growing fetus, fingerprints form where the cells of the stratum basale meet the papillae of the underlying\ndermal layer (papillary layer), resulting in the formation of the ridges on your fingers that you recognize as\nfingerprints.

What is the primary function of smooth muscle tissue?,"['When attached between two\nmovable objects, in other words, bones, contractions of the muscles cause the bones to move.

Muscle cells are excitable; they respond to a\nstimulus. They are contractile, meaning they can shorten and generate a pulling force. When attached between two\nmovable objects, in other words, bones, contractions of the muscles cause the bones to move. Some muscle\nmovement is voluntary, which means it is under conscious control. For example, a person decides to open a book\nand read a chapter on anatomy. Other movements are involuntary, meaning they are not under conscious control,\nsuch as the contraction of your pupil in bright light. Muscle tissue is classified into three types according to structure\nand function: skeletal, cardiac, and smooth (Table 4.2).', 'The muscle cell, or myocyte, develops from myoblasts derived from the mesoderm. Myocytes and\ntheir numbers remain relatively constant throughout life. Skeletal muscle tissue is arranged in bundles surrounded\nby connective tissue. Under the light microscope, muscle cells appear striated with many nuclei squeezed along the\nmembranes. The striation is due to the regular alternation of the contractile proteins actin and myosin, along with\nthe structural proteins that couple the contractile proteins to connective tissues. The cells are multinucleated as a\nresult of the fusion of the many myoblasts that fuse to form each long muscle fiber.\nCardiac muscle forms the contractile walls of the heart. The cells of cardiac muscle, known as cardiomyocytes, also\nappear striated under the microscope. Unlike skeletal muscle fibers, cardiomyocytes are single cells typically with a\nsingle centrally located nucleus. A principal characteristic of cardiomyocytes is that they contract on their own\nintrinsic rhythms without any external stimulation. Cardiomyocyte attach to one another with specialized cell\njunctions called intercalated discs. Intercalated discs have both anchoring junctions and gap junctions. Attached\ncells form long, branching cardiac muscle fibers that are, essentially, a mechanical and electrochemical syncytium\nallowing the cells to synchronize their actions. The cardiac muscle pumps blood through the body and is under\ninvoluntary control. The attachment junctions hold adjacent cells together across the dynamic pressures changes of\nthe cardiac cycle.\nSmooth muscle tissue contraction is responsible for involuntary movements in the internal organs.

The matrix usually includes a large amount of extracellular\nmaterial produced by the connective tissue cells that are embedded within it. The matrix plays a major role in the\nfunctioning of this tissue. The major component of the matrix is a ground substance often crisscrossed by protein\nfibers. This ground substance is usually a fluid, but it can also be mineralized and solid, as in bones. Connective\ntissues come in a vast variety of forms, yet they typically have in common three characteristic components: cells,\nlarge amounts of amorphous ground substance, and protein fibers.']","The primary function of smooth muscle tissue is to facilitate involuntary movements within internal organs, such as the digestive, urinary, and reproductive systems, as well as regulating blood flow in arteries.","Smooth muscle tissue contraction is responsible for involuntary movements in the internal organs.

Myocytes and\ntheir numbers remain relatively constant throughout life. Skeletal muscle tissue is arranged in bundles surrounded\nby connective tissue. Under the light microscope, muscle cells appear striated with many nuclei squeezed along the\nmembranes. The striation is due to the regular alternation of the contractile proteins actin and myosin, along with\nthe structural proteins that couple the contractile proteins to connective tissues. The cells are multinucleated as a\nresult of the fusion of the many myoblasts that fuse to form each long muscle fiber.\nCardiac muscle forms the contractile walls of the heart. The cells of cardiac muscle, known as cardiomyocytes, also\nappear striated under the microscope. Unlike skeletal muscle fibers, cardiomyocytes are single cells typically with a\nsingle centrally located nucleus. A principal characteristic of cardiomyocytes is that they contract on their own\nintrinsic rhythms without any external stimulation.

What is the primary difference between exocrine and endocrine glands?,"['A few examples of endocrine glands include the anterior pituitary, thymus, adrenal cortex, and gonads.\nExocrine Glands\nExocrine glands release their contents through a duct that leads to the epithelial surface. Mucous, sweat, saliva, and\nbreast milk are all examples of secretions from exocrine glands. They are all discharged through tubular ducts.\nSecretions into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, technically outside of the body, are of the exocrine category.\nGlandular Structure\nExocrine glands are classified as either unicellular or multicellular. The unicellular glands are scattered single cells,\nsuch as goblet cells, found in the mucous membranes of the small and large intestine.\nThe multicellular exocrine glands known as serous glands develop from simple epithelium to form a secretory\nsurface that secretes directly into an inner cavity. These glands line the internal cavities of the abdomen and chest\nand release their secretions directly into the cavities. Other multicellular exocrine glands release their contents\nthrough a tubular duct. The duct is single in a simple gland but in compound glands is divided into one or more\nbranches (Figure 4.9). In tubular glands, the ducts can be straight or coiled, whereas tubes that form pockets are\nalveolar (acinar), such as the exocrine portion of the pancreas. Combinations of tubes and pockets are known as\ntubuloalveolar (tubuloacinar) compound glands. In a branched gland, a duct is connected to more than one\nsecretory group of cells.\n4.2 • Epithelial Tissue\n137\nFIGURE 4.9\nTypes of Exocrine Glands\nExocrine glands are classified by their structure.\nMethods and Types of Secretion\nExocrine glands can be classified by their mode of secretion and the nature of the substances released, as well as by\nthe structure of the glands and shape of ducts (Figure 4.10). Merocrine secretion is the most common type of\nexocrine secretion. The secretions are enclosed in vesicles that move to the apical surface of the cell where the\ncontents are released by exocytosis. For example, watery mucous containing the glycoprotein mucin, a lubricant\nthat offers some pathogen protection is a merocrine secretion.', 'When the bladder is empty, this epithelium is convoluted and has cuboidal apical cells with\nconvex, umbrella shaped, apical surfaces. As the bladder fills with urine, this epithelium loses its convolutions and\nthe apical cells transition from cuboidal to squamous. It appears thicker and more multi-layered when the bladder is\nempty, and more stretched out and less stratified when the bladder is full and distended.

Most\nglands consist of groups of epithelial cells. A gland can be classified as an endocrine gland, a ductless gland that\nreleases secretions directly into surrounding tissues and fluids (endo- = “inside”), or an exocrine gland whose\nsecretions leave through a duct that opens directly, or indirectly, to the external environment (exo- = “outside”).\nEndocrine Glands\nThe secretions of endocrine glands are called hormones. Hormones are released into the interstitial fluid, diffused\ninto the bloodstream, and delivered to targets, in other words, cells that have receptors to bind the hormones. The\nendocrine system is part of a major regulatory system coordinating the regulation and integration of body\nresponses. A few examples of endocrine glands include the anterior pituitary, thymus, adrenal cortex, and gonads.\nExocrine Glands\nExocrine glands release their contents through a duct that leads to the epithelial surface.

It is a stratified squamous epithelial\nmembrane resting on top of connective tissue. The apical surface of this membrane is exposed to the external\nenvironment and is covered with dead, keratinized cells that help protect the body from desiccation and pathogens.\n4.2 Epithelial Tissue\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nExplain the structure and function of epithelial tissue\n•\nDistinguish between tight junctions, anchoring junctions, and gap junctions\n•\nDistinguish between simple epithelia and stratified epithelia, as well as between squamous, cuboidal, and\ncolumnar epithelia\n•\nDescribe the structure and function of endocrine and exocrine glands and their respective secretions\nMost epithelial tissues are essentially large sheets of cells covering all the surfaces of the body exposed to the\noutside world and lining the outside of organs. Epithelium also forms much of the glandular tissue of the body. Skin\nis not the only area of the body exposed to the outside. Other areas include the airways, the digestive tract, as well\nas the urinary and reproductive systems, all of which are lined by an epithelium. Hollow organs and body cavities\nthat do not connect to the exterior of the body, which includes, blood vessels and serous membranes, are lined by\nendothelium (plural = endothelia), which is a type of epithelium.\nEpithelial cells derive from all three major embryonic layers. The epithelia lining the skin, parts of the mouth and\nnose, and the anus develop from the ectoderm. Cells lining the airways and most of the digestive system originate in\nthe endoderm. The epithelium that lines vessels in the lymphatic and cardiovascular system derives from the\nmesoderm and is called an endothelium.\nAll epithelia share some important structural and functional features. This tissue is highly cellular, with little or no\nextracellular material present between cells. Adjoining cells form a specialized intercellular connection between\ntheir cell membranes called a cell junction.', 'Methods and Types of Secretion\nExocrine glands can be classified by their mode of secretion and the nature of the substances released, as well as by\nthe structure of the glands and shape of ducts (Figure 4.10). Merocrine secretion is the most common type of\nexocrine secretion. The secretions are enclosed in vesicles that move to the apical surface of the cell where the\ncontents are released by exocytosis. For example, watery mucous containing the glycoprotein mucin, a lubricant\nthat offers some pathogen protection is a merocrine secretion. The eccrine glands that produce and secrete sweat\nare another example.\n138\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 4.10\nModes of Glandular Secretion\n(a) In merocrine secretion, the cell remains intact. (b) In apocrine secretion, the apical\nportion of the cell is released, as well. (c) In holocrine secretion, the cell is destroyed as it releases its product and the cell itself becomes\npart of the secretion.\nApocrine secretion accumulates near the apical portion of the cell. That portion of the cell and its secretory\ncontents pinch off from the cell and are released. Apocrine sweat glands in the axillary and genital areas release\nfatty secretions that local bacteria break down; this causes body odor. Both merocrine and apocrine glands continue\nto produce and secrete their contents with little damage caused to the cell because the nucleus and golgi regions\nremain intact after secretion.\nIn contrast, the process of holocrine secretion involves the rupture and destruction of the entire gland cell. The cell\naccumulates its secretory products and releases them only when it bursts. New gland cells differentiate from cells\nin the surrounding tissue to replace those lost by secretion. The sebaceous glands that produce the oils on the skin\nand hair are holocrine glands/cells (Figure 4.11).\n4.2 • Epithelial Tissue\n139\nFIGURE 4.11\nSebaceous Glands\nThese glands secrete oils that lubricate and protect the skin. They are holocrine glands and they are\ndestroyed after releasing their contents. New glandular cells form to replace the cells that are lost. LM × 400.', 'There are two types of sweat glands, each\nsecreting slightly different products.\nAn eccrine sweat gland is type of gland that produces a hypotonic sweat for thermoregulation. These glands are\nfound all over the skin’s surface, but are especially abundant on the palms of the hand, the soles of the feet, and the\nforehead (Figure 5.14). They are coiled glands lying deep in the dermis, with the duct rising up to a pore on the skin\nsurface, where the sweat is released. This type of sweat, released by exocytosis, is hypotonic and composed mostly\nof water, with some salt, antibodies, traces of metabolic waste, and dermicidin, an antimicrobial peptide. Eccrine\nglands are a primary component of thermoregulation in humans and thus help to maintain homeostasis.\nFIGURE 5.14\nEccrine Gland\nEccrine glands are coiled glands in the dermis that release sweat that is mostly water.\nAn apocrine sweat gland is usually associated with hair follicles in densely hairy areas, such as armpits and genital\nregions. Apocrine sweat glands are larger than eccrine sweat glands and lie deeper in the dermis, sometimes even\nreaching the hypodermis, with the duct normally emptying into the hair follicle. In addition to water and salts,\napocrine sweat includes organic compounds that make the sweat thicker and subject to bacterial decomposition\nand subsequent smell. The release of this sweat is under both nervous and hormonal control, and plays a role in the\npoorly understood human pheromone response. Most commercial antiperspirants use an aluminum-based\ncompound as their primary active ingredient to stop sweat. When the antiperspirant enters the sweat gland duct,\nthe aluminum-based compounds precipitate due to a change in pH and form a physical block in the duct, which\nprevents sweat from coming out of the pore.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nSweating regulates body temperature. The composition of the sweat determines whether body odor is a byproduct\nof sweating.

Where do many different cells that contribute to the formation of connective tissue originate?,"['Each of these categories is characterized by specific functions that\ncontribute to the overall health and maintenance of the body. A disruption of the structure is a sign of injury or\ndisease. Such changes can be detected through histology, the microscopic study of tissue appearance, organization,\nand function.\nThe Four Types of Tissues\nEpithelial tissue, also referred to as epithelium, refers to the sheets of cells that cover exterior surfaces of the body,\nline internal cavities and passageways, and form certain glands. Connective tissue, as its name implies, binds the\ncells and organs of the body together and functions in the protection, support, and integration of all parts of the\nbody. Muscle tissue is excitable, responding to stimulation and contracting to provide movement, and occurs as\nthree major types: skeletal (voluntary) muscle, smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle in the heart. Nervous tissue is\nalso excitable, allowing the propagation of electrochemical signals in the form of nerve impulses that communicate\nbetween different regions of the body (Figure 4.2).\nThe next level of organization is the organ, where several types of tissues come together to form a working unit. Just\nas knowing the structure and function of cells helps you in your study of tissues, knowledge of tissues will help you\nunderstand how organs function. The epithelial and connective tissues are discussed in detail in this chapter. Muscle\nand nervous tissues will be discussed only briefly in this chapter.\n126\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 4.2\nFour Types of Tissue: Body\nThe four types of tissues are exemplified in nervous tissue, stratified squamous epithelial\ntissue, cardiac muscle tissue, and connective tissue. (Micrographs provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School ©\n2012)\nEmbryonic Origin of Tissues\nThe zygote, or fertilized egg, is a single cell formed by the fusion of an egg and sperm. After fertilization the zygote\ngives rise to rapid mitotic cycles, generating many cells to form the embryo. The first embryonic cells generated\nhave the ability to differentiate into any type of cell in the body and, as such, are called totipotent, meaning each\nhas the capacity to divide, differentiate, and develop into a new organism.', 'The matrix usually includes a large amount of extracellular\nmaterial produced by the connective tissue cells that are embedded within it. The matrix plays a major role in the\nfunctioning of this tissue. The major component of the matrix is a ground substance often crisscrossed by protein\nfibers. This ground substance is usually a fluid, but it can also be mineralized and solid, as in bones. Connective\ntissues come in a vast variety of forms, yet they typically have in common three characteristic components: cells,\nlarge amounts of amorphous ground substance, and protein fibers. The amount and structure of each component\ncorrelates with the function of the tissue, from the rigid ground substance in bones supporting the body to the\ninclusion of specialized cells; for example, a phagocytic cell that engulfs pathogens and also rids tissue of cellular\ndebris.\nFunctions of Connective Tissues\nConnective tissues perform many functions in the body, but most importantly, they support and connect other\ntissues; from the connective tissue sheath that surrounds muscle cells, to the tendons that attach muscles to bones,\nand to the skeleton that supports the positions of the body. Protection is another major function of connective\ntissue, in the form of fibrous capsules and bones that protect delicate organs and, of course, the skeletal system.\nSpecialized cells in connective tissue defend the body from microorganisms that enter the body. Transport of fluid,\nnutrients, waste, and chemical messengers is ensured by specialized fluid connective tissues, such as blood and\nlymph. Adipose cells store surplus energy in the form of fat and contribute to the thermal insulation of the body.\nEmbryonic Connective Tissue\nAll connective tissues derive from the mesodermal layer of the embryo (see Figure 4.3). The first connective tissue\n140\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nto develop in the embryo is mesenchyme, the stem cell line from which all connective tissues are later derived.\nClusters of mesenchymal cells are scattered throughout adult tissue and supply the cells needed for replacement\nand repair after a connective tissue injury. A second type of embryonic connective tissue forms in the umbilical cord,\ncalled mucous connective tissue or Wharton’s jelly.', 'The different types of epithelial tissues are\ncharacterized by their cellular shapes and\narrangements: squamous, cuboidal, or columnar\nepithelia. Single cell layers form simple epithelia,\nwhereas stacked cells form stratified epithelia. Very\nfew capillaries penetrate these tissues.\nGlands are secretory tissues and organs that are\nderived from epithelial tissues. Exocrine glands release\ntheir products through ducts. Endocrine glands secrete\nhormones directly into the interstitial fluid and blood\nstream. Glands are classified both according to the\ntype of secretion and by their structure. Merocrine\nglands secrete products as they are synthesized.\nApocrine glands release secretions by pinching off the\napical portion of the cell, whereas holocrine gland cells\nstore their secretions until they rupture and release\ntheir contents. In this case, the cell becomes part of\nthe secretion.\n4.3 Connective Tissue Supports and\nProtects\nConnective tissue is a heterogeneous tissue with many\ncell shapes and tissue architecture. Structurally, all\nconnective tissues contain cells that are embedded in\nan extracellular matrix stabilized by proteins. The\nchemical nature and physical layout of the extracellular\nmatrix and proteins vary enormously among tissues,\nreflecting the variety of functions that connective\ntissue fulfills in the body. Connective tissues separate\nand cushion organs, protecting them from shifting or\ntraumatic injury. Connect tissues provide support and\nassist movement, store and transport energy\nmolecules, protect against infections, and contribute to\ntemperature homeostasis.\nMany different cells contribute to the formation of\nconnective tissues.

Protein fibers\nfall into three major groups: collagen fibers that are\nthick, strong, flexible, and resist stretch; reticular fibers\nthat are thin and form a supportive mesh; and elastin\nfibers that are thin and elastic.\nThe major types of connective tissue are connective\ntissue proper, supportive tissue, and fluid tissue. Loose\nconnective tissue proper includes adipose tissue,\nareolar tissue, and reticular tissue. These serve to hold\norgans and other tissues in place and, in the case of\nadipose tissue, isolate and store energy reserves. The\nmatrix is the most abundant feature for loose tissue\nalthough adipose tissue does not have much\nextracellular matrix. Dense connective tissue proper is\nricher in fibers and may be regular, with fibers oriented\nin parallel as in ligaments and tendons, or irregular,\nwith fibers oriented in several directions.

Bone tissue\nis highly vascularized.', 'The number and type of adipocytes\ndepends on the tissue and location, and vary among individuals in the population.\nThe mesenchymal cell is a multipotent adult stem cell. These cells can differentiate into any type of connective\ntissue cells needed for repair and healing of damaged tissue.\nThe macrophage cell is a large cell derived from a monocyte, a type of blood cell, which enters the connective tissue\nmatrix from the blood vessels. The macrophage cells are an essential component of the immune system, which is\nthe body’s defense against potential pathogens and degraded host cells. When stimulated, macrophages release\ncytokines, small proteins that act as chemical messengers. Cytokines recruit other cells of the immune system to\ninfected sites and stimulate their activities. Roaming, or free, macrophages move rapidly by amoeboid movement,\nengulfing infectious agents and cellular debris. In contrast, fixed macrophages are permanent residents of their\ntissues.\nThe mast cell, found in connective tissue proper, has many cytoplasmic granules. These granules contain the\nchemical signals histamine and heparin. When irritated or damaged, mast cells release histamine, an inflammatory\nmediator, which causes vasodilation and increased blood flow at a site of injury or infection, along with itching,\nswelling, and redness you recognize as an allergic response. Like blood cells, mast cells are derived from\nhematopoietic stem cells and are part of the immune system.\nConnective Tissue Fibers and Ground Substance\nThree main types of fibers are secreted by fibroblasts: collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers. Collagen\nfiber is made from fibrous protein subunits linked together to form a long and straight fiber. Collagen fibers, while\nflexible, have great tensile strength, resist stretching, and give ligaments and tendons their characteristic resilience\nand strength. These fibers hold connective tissues together, even during the movement of the body.\nElastic fiber contains the protein elastin along with lesser amounts of other proteins and glycoproteins. The main\nproperty of elastin is that after being stretched or compressed, it will return to its original shape. Elastic fibers are\nprominent in elastic tissues found in skin and the elastic ligaments of the vertebral column.']","Many different cells that contribute to the formation of connective tissue originate in the mesodermal germ layer of the embryo, differentiating from mesenchyme and hematopoietic tissue in the bone marrow.",They originate in the mesodermal germ layer and differentiate from mesenchyme and hematopoietic tissue in the bone marrow.

Do you think about covering it with\nmakeup, adding a tattoo, or maybe a body piercing? Or do you think about the fact that the skin belongs to one of\nthe body’s most essential and dynamic systems: the integumentary system? The integumentary system refers to the\nskin and its accessory structures, and it is responsible for much more than simply lending to your outward\nappearance. In the adult human body, the skin makes up about 16 percent of body weight and covers an area of 1.5\nto 2 m2. In fact, the skin and accessory structures are the largest organ system in the human body. As such, the skin\nprotects your inner organs and it is in need of daily care and protection to maintain its health. This chapter will\nintroduce the structure and functions of the integumentary system, as well as some of the diseases, disorders, and\ninjuries that can affect this system.', '5.3 Functions of the Integumentary System\nThe skin plays important roles in protection, sensing\nstimuli, thermoregulation, and vitamin D synthesis. It is\nthe first layer of defense to prevent dehydration,\ninfection, and injury to the rest of the body. Sweat\nglands in the skin allow the skin surface to cool when\nthe body gets overheated. Thermoregulation is also\naccomplished by the dilation or constriction of heat-\ncarrying blood vessels in the skin. Immune cells\npresent among the skin layers patrol the areas to keep\nthem free of foreign materials. Fat stores in the\nhypodermis aid in both thermoregulation and\nprotection. Finally, the skin plays a role in the synthesis\nof vitamin D, which is necessary for our well-being but\nnot easily available in natural foods.\n5.4 Diseases, Disorders, and Injuries of the\nIntegumentary System\nSkin cancer is a result of damage to the DNA of skin\ncells, often due to excessive exposure to UV radiation.\nBasal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are\nhighly curable, and arise from cells in the stratum\nbasale and stratum spinosum, respectively. Melanoma\nis the most dangerous form of skin cancer, affecting\nmelanocytes, which can spread/metastasize to other\norgans. Burns are an injury to the skin that occur as a\nresult of exposure to extreme heat, radiation, or\nchemicals. First-degree and second-degree burns\nusually heal quickly, but third-degree burns can be\nfatal because they penetrate the full thickness of the\nskin. Scars occur when there is repair of skin damage.\nFibroblasts generate scar tissue in the form of collagen,\nwhich forms a basket-weave pattern that looks\ndifferent from normal skin.\nBedsores and stretch marks are the result of excessive\npressure on the skin and underlying tissue. Bedsores\nare characterized by necrosis of tissue due to\nimmobility, whereas stretch marks result from rapid\ngrowth. Eczema is an allergic reaction that manifests as\na rash, and acne results from clogged sebaceous\nglands. Eczema and acne are usually long-term skin\nconditions that may be treated successfully in mild\ncases.', 'In the adult human body, the skin makes up about 16 percent of body weight and covers an area of 1.5\nto 2 m2.

The skin and its accessory structures make up the\nintegumentary system, which provides the body with overall protection. The skin is made of multiple layers of cells\nand tissues, which are held to underlying structures by connective tissue (Figure 5.2). The deeper layer of skin is\nwell vascularized (has numerous blood vessels). It also has numerous sensory, and autonomic and sympathetic\nFigure 5.1\nYour skin is a vital part of your life and appearance (a–b).

Beneath the\ndermis lies the hypodermis, which is composed mainly of loose connective and fatty tissues.', 'The topmost\nlayer, the stratum corneum, consists of dead cells that\nshed periodically and is progressively replaced by cells\nformed from the basal layer. The stratum basale also\ncontains melanocytes, cells that produce melanin, the\npigment primarily responsible for giving skin its color.\nMelanin is transferred to keratinocytes in the stratum\nspinosum to protect cells from UV rays.\nThe dermis connects the epidermis to the hypodermis,\nand provides strength and elasticity due to the\npresence of collagen and elastin fibers.

The hypodermis, deep to\nthe dermis of skin, is the connective tissue that\nconnects the dermis to underlying structures; it also\nharbors adipose tissue for fat storage and protection.\n5.2 Accessory Structures of the Skin\nAccessory structures of the skin include hair, nails,\nsweat glands, and sebaceous glands. Hair is made of\n5 • Chapter Review\n187\ndead keratinized cells, and gets its color from melanin\npigments. Nails, also made of dead keratinized cells,\nprotect the extremities of our fingers and toes from\nmechanical damage. Sweat glands and sebaceous\nglands produce sweat and sebum, respectively. Each of\nthese fluids has a role to play in maintaining\nhomeostasis. Sweat cools the body surface when it\ngets overheated and helps excrete small amounts of\nmetabolic waste. Sebum acts as a natural moisturizer\nand keeps the dead, flaky, outer keratin layer healthy.\n5.3 Functions of the Integumentary System\nThe skin plays important roles in protection, sensing\nstimuli, thermoregulation, and vitamin D synthesis. It is\nthe first layer of defense to prevent dehydration,\ninfection, and injury to the rest of the body. Sweat\nglands in the skin allow the skin surface to cool when\nthe body gets overheated.

The integumentary system refers to the\nskin and its accessory structures, and it is responsible for much more than simply lending to your outward\nappearance. In the adult human body, the skin makes up about 16 percent of body weight and covers an area of 1.5\nto 2 m2.

This chapter will\nintroduce the structure and functions of the integumentary system, as well as some of the diseases, disorders, and\ninjuries that can affect this system.', 'Adipose tissue present in the hypodermis consists of fat-storing cells called adipocytes. This stored fat\ncan serve as an energy reserve, insulate the body to prevent heat loss, and act as a cushion to protect underlying\nstructures from trauma.\nWhere the fat is deposited and accumulates within the hypodermis depends on hormones (testosterone,\nestrogen, insulin, glucagon, leptin, and others), as well as genetic factors. Fat distribution changes as our bodies\nmature and age. Males tend to accumulate fat in different areas (neck, arms, lower back, and abdomen) than do\nfemales (breasts, hips, thighs, and buttocks). The body mass index (BMI) is often used as a measure of fat,\nalthough this measure is, in fact, derived from a mathematical formula that compares body weight (mass) to\nheight. Therefore, its accuracy as a health indicator can be called into question in individuals who are extremely\nphysically fit.\nIn many animals, there is a pattern of storing excess calories as fat to be used in times when food is not readily\navailable. In much of the developed world, insufficient exercise coupled with the ready availability and\nconsumption of high-calorie foods have resulted in unwanted accumulations of adipose tissue in many people.\nAlthough periodic accumulation of excess fat may have provided an evolutionary advantage to our ancestors,\nwho experienced unpredictable bouts of famine, it is now becoming chronic and considered a major health\nthreat. Recent studies indicate that a distressing percentage of our population is overweight and/or clinically\nobese. Not only is this a problem for the individuals affected, but it also has a severe impact on our healthcare\nsystem. Changes in lifestyle, specifically in diet and exercise, are the best ways to control body fat accumulation,\nespecially when it reaches levels that increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes.\n5.1 • Layers of the Skin\n169\nFIGURE 5.8\nSkin Pigmentation\nThe relative coloration of the skin depends of the amount of melanin produced by melanocytes in the\nstratum basale and taken up by keratinocytes.\nMelanin occurs in two primary forms.

It also is the first line of defense against abrasive activity due to contact with grit, microbes, or harmful\nchemicals. Sweat excreted from sweat glands deters microbes from over-colonizing the skin surface by generating\ndermicidin, which has antibiotic properties.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nTattooing has a long history, dating back thousands of years ago. The dyes used in tattooing typically derive from\nmetals. A person with tattoos should be cautious when having a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan because an\nMRI machine uses powerful magnets to create images of the soft tissues of the body, which could react with the\nmetals contained in the tattoo dyes. Watch this video (http://openstax.org/l/tattoo) to learn more about tattooing.\nSensory Function\nThe fact that you can feel an ant crawling on your skin, allowing you to flick it off before it bites, is because the skin,\nand especially the hairs projecting from hair follicles in the skin, can sense changes in the environment. The hair root\nplexus surrounding the base of the hair follicle senses a disturbance, and then transmits the information to the\ncentral nervous system (brain and spinal cord), which can then respond by activating the skeletal muscles of your\neyes to see the ant and the skeletal muscles of the body to act against the ant.\nThe skin acts as a sense organ because the epidermis, dermis, and the hypodermis contain specialized sensory\nnerve structures that detect touch, surface temperature, and pain. These receptors are more concentrated on the\ntips of the fingers, which are most sensitive to touch, especially the Meissner corpuscle (tactile corpuscle) (Figure\n5.15), which responds to light touch, and the Pacinian corpuscle (lamellated corpuscle), which responds to\nEveryday Connection\nTattoos and Piercings\nThe word “armor” evokes several images.

What is the function of elastin fibers in the skin?,"['The dermis is made of two layers of connective tissue\nthat compose an interconnected mesh of elastin and collagenous fibers, produced by fibroblasts (Figure 5.7).\n5.1 • Layers of the Skin\n167\nFIGURE 5.7\nLayers of the Dermis\nThis stained slide shows the two components of the dermis—the papillary layer and the reticular\nlayer. Both are made of connective tissue with fibers of collagen extending from one to the other, making the border between the two\nsomewhat indistinct. The dermal papillae extending into the epidermis belong to the papillary layer, whereas the dense collagen fiber\nbundles below belong to the reticular layer. LM × 10. (credit: modification of work by “kilbad”/Wikimedia Commons)\nPapillary Layer\nThe papillary layer is made of loose, areolar connective tissue, which means the collagen and elastin fibers of this\nlayer form a loose mesh. This superficial layer of the dermis projects into the stratum basale of the epidermis to\nform finger-like dermal papillae (see Figure 5.7). Within the papillary layer are fibroblasts, a small number of fat\ncells (adipocytes), and an abundance of small blood vessels. In addition, the papillary layer contains phagocytes,\ndefensive cells that help fight bacteria or other infections that have breached the skin. This layer also contains\nlymphatic capillaries, nerve fibers, and touch receptors called the Meissner corpuscles.\nReticular Layer\nUnderlying the papillary layer is the much thicker reticular layer, composed of dense, irregular connective tissue.\nThis layer is well vascularized and has a rich sensory and sympathetic nerve supply. The reticular layer appears\nreticulated (net-like) due to a tight meshwork of fibers. Elastin fibers provide some elasticity to the skin, enabling\nmovement. Collagen fibers provide structure and tensile strength, with strands of collagen extending into both the\npapillary layer and the hypodermis. In addition, collagen binds water to keep the skin hydrated. Collagen injections\nand Retin-A creams help restore skin turgor by either introducing collagen externally or stimulating blood flow and\nrepair of the dermis, respectively.', 'Collagen fibers, while\nflexible, have great tensile strength, resist stretching, and give ligaments and tendons their characteristic resilience\nand strength. These fibers hold connective tissues together, even during the movement of the body.\nElastic fiber contains the protein elastin along with lesser amounts of other proteins and glycoproteins. The main\nproperty of elastin is that after being stretched or compressed, it will return to its original shape. Elastic fibers are\nprominent in elastic tissues found in skin and the elastic ligaments of the vertebral column.\nReticular fiber is also formed from the same protein subunits as collagen fibers; however, these fibers remain\nnarrow and are arrayed in a branching network. They are found throughout the body, but are most abundant in the\nreticular tissue of soft organs, such as liver and spleen, where they anchor and provide structural support to the\nparenchyma (the functional cells, blood vessels, and nerves of the organ).\nAll of these fiber types are embedded in ground substance. Secreted by fibroblasts, ground substance is made of\npolysaccharides, specifically hyaluronic acid, and proteins. These combine to form a proteoglycan with a protein\ncore and polysaccharide branches. The proteoglycan attracts and traps available moisture forming the clear,\nviscous, colorless matrix you now know as ground substance.\nLoose Connective Tissue\nLoose connective tissue is found between many organs where it acts both to absorb shock and bind tissues\ntogether. It allows water, salts, and various nutrients to diffuse through to adjacent or imbedded cells and tissues.\nAdipose tissue consists mostly of fat storage cells, with little extracellular matrix (Figure 4.13). A large number of\ncapillaries allow rapid storage and mobilization of lipid molecules. White adipose tissue is most abundant. It can\nappear yellow and owes its color to carotene and related pigments from plant food. White fat contributes mostly to\nlipid storage and can serve as insulation from cold temperatures and mechanical injuries. White adipose tissue can\n142\n4 • The Tissue Level of Organization\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nbe found protecting the kidneys and cushioning the back of the eye.', 'The number and type of adipocytes\ndepends on the tissue and location, and vary among individuals in the population.\nThe mesenchymal cell is a multipotent adult stem cell. These cells can differentiate into any type of connective\ntissue cells needed for repair and healing of damaged tissue.\nThe macrophage cell is a large cell derived from a monocyte, a type of blood cell, which enters the connective tissue\nmatrix from the blood vessels. The macrophage cells are an essential component of the immune system, which is\nthe body’s defense against potential pathogens and degraded host cells. When stimulated, macrophages release\ncytokines, small proteins that act as chemical messengers. Cytokines recruit other cells of the immune system to\ninfected sites and stimulate their activities. Roaming, or free, macrophages move rapidly by amoeboid movement,\nengulfing infectious agents and cellular debris. In contrast, fixed macrophages are permanent residents of their\ntissues.\nThe mast cell, found in connective tissue proper, has many cytoplasmic granules. These granules contain the\nchemical signals histamine and heparin. When irritated or damaged, mast cells release histamine, an inflammatory\nmediator, which causes vasodilation and increased blood flow at a site of injury or infection, along with itching,\nswelling, and redness you recognize as an allergic response. Like blood cells, mast cells are derived from\nhematopoietic stem cells and are part of the immune system.\nConnective Tissue Fibers and Ground Substance\nThree main types of fibers are secreted by fibroblasts: collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and reticular fibers. Collagen\nfiber is made from fibrous protein subunits linked together to form a long and straight fiber. Collagen fibers, while\nflexible, have great tensile strength, resist stretching, and give ligaments and tendons their characteristic resilience\nand strength. These fibers hold connective tissues together, even during the movement of the body.\nElastic fiber contains the protein elastin along with lesser amounts of other proteins and glycoproteins. The main\nproperty of elastin is that after being stretched or compressed, it will return to its original shape. Elastic fibers are\nprominent in elastic tissues found in skin and the elastic ligaments of the vertebral column.', 'Reticular tissue is a mesh-like, supportive framework for soft organs such as lymphatic tissue, the spleen, and the\nliver (Figure 4.14). Reticular cells produce the reticular fibers that form the network onto which other cells attach. It\nderives its name from the Latin reticulus, which means “little net.”\nFIGURE 4.14\nReticular Tissue\nThis is a loose connective tissue made up of a network of reticular fibers that provides a supportive\nframework for soft organs. LM × 1600. (Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)\nDense Connective Tissue\nDense connective tissue contains more collagen fibers than does loose connective tissue. As a consequence, it\ndisplays greater resistance to stretching. There are two major categories of dense connective tissue: regular and\nirregular. Dense regular connective tissue fibers are parallel to each other, enhancing tensile strength and resistance\nto stretching in the direction of the fiber orientations. Ligaments and tendons are made of dense regular connective\ntissue, but in ligaments not all fibers are parallel. Dense regular elastic tissue contains elastin fibers in addition to\ncollagen fibers, which allows the ligament to return to its original length after stretching. The ligaments in the vocal\nfolds and between the vertebrae in the vertebral column are elastic.\nIn dense irregular connective tissue, the direction of fibers is random. This arrangement gives the tissue greater\nstrength in all directions and less strength in one particular direction. In some tissues, fibers crisscross and form a\nmesh. In other tissues, stretching in several directions is achieved by alternating layers where fibers run in the same\n4.3 • Connective Tissue Supports and Protects\n143\norientation in each layer, and it is the layers themselves that are stacked at an angle.

The keratinocytes that compose the stratum lucidum are dead and flattened (see Figure 5.5).\nThese cells are densely packed with eleidin, a clear protein, derived from keratohyalin, which gives these cells their\ntransparent (i.e., lucid) appearance.\nStratum Corneum\nThe stratum corneum is the most superficial layer of the epidermis and is the layer exposed to the outside\nenvironment (see Figure 5.5). The increased keratinization (also called cornification) of the cells in this layer gives it\nits name. There are usually 15 to 30 layers of cells in the stratum corneum. This dry, dead layer helps prevent the\npenetration of microbes and the dehydration of underlying tissues, and provides a mechanical protection against\nabrasion for the more delicate, underlying layers. Cells in this layer are shed periodically and are replaced by cells\npushed up from the stratum granulosum (or stratum lucidum in the case of the palms and soles of feet). The entire\nlayer is replaced during a period of about 4 weeks. Cosmetic procedures, such as microdermabrasion, help remove\nsome of the dry, upper layer and aim to keep the skin looking “fresh” and healthy.\nDermis\nThe dermis might be considered the “core” of the integumentary system (derma- = “skin”), as distinct from the\nepidermis (epi- = “upon” or “over”) and hypodermis (hypo- = “below”). It contains blood and lymph vessels, nerves,\nand other structures, such as hair follicles and sweat glands. The dermis is made of two layers of connective tissue\nthat compose an interconnected mesh of elastin and collagenous fibers, produced by fibroblasts (Figure 5.7).\n5.1 • Layers of the Skin\n167\nFIGURE 5.7\nLayers of the Dermis\nThis stained slide shows the two components of the dermis—the papillary layer and the reticular\nlayer.

The medulla forms the central core of the hair, which is surrounded by the cortex, a layer of\ncompressed, keratinized cells that is covered by an outer layer of very hard, keratinized cells known as the cuticle.\nThese layers are depicted in a longitudinal cross-section of the hair follicle (Figure 5.12), although not all hair has a\nmedullary layer. Hair texture (straight, curly) is determined by the shape and structure of the cortex, and to the\nextent that it is present, the medulla. The shape and structure of these layers are, in turn, determined by the shape\nof the hair follicle. Hair growth begins with the production of keratinocytes by the basal cells of the hair bulb. As new\ncells are deposited at the hair bulb, the hair shaft is pushed through the follicle toward the surface. Keratinization is\ncompleted as the cells are pushed to the skin surface to form the shaft of hair that is externally visible. The external\nhair is completely dead and composed entirely of keratin. For this reason, our hair does not have sensation.\nFurthermore, you can cut your hair or shave without damaging the hair structure because the cut is superficial.

At the end of this phase, which lasts about 2 to 4 months, another anagen phase begins. The\nbasal cells in the hair matrix then produce a new hair follicle, which pushes the old hair out as the growth cycle\nrepeats itself. Hair typically grows at the rate of 0.3 mm per day during the anagen phase. On average, 50 hairs are\nlost and replaced per day. Hair loss occurs if there is more hair shed than what is replaced and can happen due to\nhormonal or dietary changes. Hair loss can also result from the aging process, or the influence of hormones.\n174\n5 • The Integumentary System\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nHair Color\nSimilar to the skin, hair gets its color from the pigment melanin, produced by melanocytes in the hair papilla.\nDifferent hair color results from differences in the type of melanin, which is genetically determined. As a person\nages, the melanin production decreases, and hair tends to lose its color and becomes gray and/or white.\nNails\nThe nail bed is a specialized structure of the epidermis that is found at the tips of our fingers and toes. The nail body\nis formed on the nail bed, and protects the tips of our fingers and toes as they are the farthest extremities and the\nparts of the body that experience the maximum mechanical stress (Figure 5.13). In addition, the nail body forms a\nback-support for picking up small objects with the fingers. The nail body is composed of densely packed dead\nkeratinocytes. The epidermis in this part of the body has evolved a specialized structure upon which nails can form.\nThe nail body forms at the nail root, which has a matrix of proliferating cells from the stratum basale that enables\nthe nail to grow continuously. The lateral nail fold overlaps the nail on the sides, helping to anchor the nail body. The\nnail fold that meets the proximal end of the nail body forms the nail cuticle, also called the eponychium.']",The external root sheath is made of basal cells at the base of the hair root and is an extension of the epidermis that encloses the hair root.,"The external root sheath is an extension of the epidermis, made of basal cells at the base of the hair root and tends to be more keratinous in the upper regions."

Hair also has a\nsensory function due to sensory innervation by a hair root plexus surrounding the base of each hair follicle. Hair is\nextremely sensitive to air movement or other disturbances in the environment, much more so than the skin surface.\nThis feature is also useful for the detection of the presence of insects or other potentially damaging substances on\nthe skin surface. Each hair root is connected to a smooth muscle called the arrector pili that contracts in response\nto nerve signals from the sympathetic nervous system, making the external hair shaft “stand up.” The primary\npurpose for this is to trap a layer of air to add insulation. This is visible in humans as goose bumps and even more\nobvious in animals, such as when a frightened cat raises its fur. Of course, this is much more obvious in organisms\nwith a heavier coat than most humans, such as dogs and cats.\nHair Growth\nHair grows and is eventually shed and replaced by new hair. This occurs in three phases. The first is the anagen\nphase, during which cells divide rapidly at the root of the hair, pushing the hair shaft up and out. The length of this\nphase is measured in years, typically from 2 to 7 years. The catagen phase lasts only 2 to 3 weeks, and marks a\ntransition from the hair follicle’s active growth. Finally, during the telogen phase, the hair follicle is at rest and no\nnew growth occurs. At the end of this phase, which lasts about 2 to 4 months, another anagen phase begins.

The\ncondition is especially noticeable on darker skin. (credit: (a) Klaus D. Peter (b) Owl Bridge Media / Wikimedia.)\nOther changes in the appearance of skin coloration can be indicative of diseases associated with other body\nsystems. Liver disease or liver cancer can cause the accumulation of bile and the yellow pigment bilirubin,\nleading to the skin appearing yellow or jaundiced (jaune is the French word for “yellow”). Tumors of the pituitary\ngland can result in the secretion of large amounts of melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), which results in a\ndarkening of the skin. Similarly, Addison’s disease can stimulate the release of excess amounts of\nadrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which can give the skin a deep bronze color. A sudden drop in oxygenation\ncan affect skin color, causing the skin to initially turn ashen (white). With a prolonged reduction in oxygen levels,\ndark red deoxyhemoglobin becomes dominant in the blood, making the skin appear blue, a condition referred to\nas cyanosis (kyanos is the Greek word for “blue”).

(credit: “Wbensmith”/Wikimedia Commons)\nThermoregulation\nThe integumentary system helps regulate body temperature through its tight association with the sympathetic\nnervous system, the division of the nervous system involved in our fight-or-flight responses. The sympathetic\nnervous system is continuously monitoring body temperature and initiating appropriate motor responses. Recall\nthat sweat glands, accessory structures to the skin, secrete water, salt, and other substances to cool the body when\nit becomes warm. Even when the body does not appear to be noticeably sweating, approximately 500 mL of sweat\n(insensible perspiration) are secreted a day. If the body becomes excessively warm due to high temperatures,\nvigorous activity (Figure 5.16ac), or a combination of the two, sweat glands will be stimulated by the sympathetic\nnervous system to produce large amounts of sweat, as much as 0.7 to 1.5 L per hour for an active person. When the\nsweat evaporates from the skin surface, the body is cooled as body heat is dissipated.\nIn addition to sweating, arterioles in the dermis dilate so that excess heat carried by the blood can dissipate through\nthe skin and into the surrounding environment (Figure 5.16b).

The hair root\nplexus surrounding the base of the hair follicle senses a disturbance, and then transmits the information to the\ncentral nervous system (brain and spinal cord), which can then respond by activating the skeletal muscles of your\neyes to see the ant and the skeletal muscles of the body to act against the ant.\nThe skin acts as a sense organ because the epidermis, dermis, and the hypodermis contain specialized sensory\nnerve structures that detect touch, surface temperature, and pain. These receptors are more concentrated on the\ntips of the fingers, which are most sensitive to touch, especially the Meissner corpuscle (tactile corpuscle) (Figure\n5.15), which responds to light touch, and the Pacinian corpuscle (lamellated corpuscle), which responds to\nEveryday Connection\nTattoos and Piercings\nThe word “armor” evokes several images.

It is particularly concentrated in sensitive areas such as the tips of the fingers.",A type of touch receptor located in a dermal papilla adjacent to the basement membrane and stratum basale of the overlying epidermis.

(credit: “Wbensmith”/Wikimedia Commons)\nThermoregulation\nThe integumentary system helps regulate body temperature through its tight association with the sympathetic\nnervous system, the division of the nervous system involved in our fight-or-flight responses. The sympathetic\nnervous system is continuously monitoring body temperature and initiating appropriate motor responses. Recall\nthat sweat glands, accessory structures to the skin, secrete water, salt, and other substances to cool the body when\nit becomes warm. Even when the body does not appear to be noticeably sweating, approximately 500 mL of sweat\n(insensible perspiration) are secreted a day. If the body becomes excessively warm due to high temperatures,\nvigorous activity (Figure 5.16ac), or a combination of the two, sweat glands will be stimulated by the sympathetic\nnervous system to produce large amounts of sweat, as much as 0.7 to 1.5 L per hour for an active person. When the\nsweat evaporates from the skin surface, the body is cooled as body heat is dissipated.\nIn addition to sweating, arterioles in the dermis dilate so that excess heat carried by the blood can dissipate through\nthe skin and into the surrounding environment (Figure 5.16b). This accounts for the skin redness that many people\nexperience when exercising.\n178\n5 • The Integumentary System\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 5.16\nThermoregulation\nDuring strenuous physical activities, such as skiing (a) or running (c), the dermal blood vessels dilate\nand sweat secretion increases (b). These mechanisms prevent the body from overheating. In contrast, the dermal blood vessels constrict to\nminimize heat loss in response to low temperatures (b).', 'There are two types of sweat glands, each\nsecreting slightly different products.\nAn eccrine sweat gland is type of gland that produces a hypotonic sweat for thermoregulation. These glands are\nfound all over the skin’s surface, but are especially abundant on the palms of the hand, the soles of the feet, and the\nforehead (Figure 5.14). They are coiled glands lying deep in the dermis, with the duct rising up to a pore on the skin\nsurface, where the sweat is released. This type of sweat, released by exocytosis, is hypotonic and composed mostly\nof water, with some salt, antibodies, traces of metabolic waste, and dermicidin, an antimicrobial peptide. Eccrine\nglands are a primary component of thermoregulation in humans and thus help to maintain homeostasis.\nFIGURE 5.14\nEccrine Gland\nEccrine glands are coiled glands in the dermis that release sweat that is mostly water.\nAn apocrine sweat gland is usually associated with hair follicles in densely hairy areas, such as armpits and genital\nregions. Apocrine sweat glands are larger than eccrine sweat glands and lie deeper in the dermis, sometimes even\nreaching the hypodermis, with the duct normally emptying into the hair follicle. In addition to water and salts,\napocrine sweat includes organic compounds that make the sweat thicker and subject to bacterial decomposition\nand subsequent smell. The release of this sweat is under both nervous and hormonal control, and plays a role in the\npoorly understood human pheromone response. Most commercial antiperspirants use an aluminum-based\ncompound as their primary active ingredient to stop sweat. When the antiperspirant enters the sweat gland duct,\nthe aluminum-based compounds precipitate due to a change in pH and form a physical block in the duct, which\nprevents sweat from coming out of the pore.\nINTERACTIVE LINK\nSweating regulates body temperature.

The epidermis in this part of the body has evolved a specialized structure upon which nails can form.\nThe nail body forms at the nail root, which has a matrix of proliferating cells from the stratum basale that enables\nthe nail to grow continuously. The lateral nail fold overlaps the nail on the sides, helping to anchor the nail body. The\nnail fold that meets the proximal end of the nail body forms the nail cuticle, also called the eponychium. The nail\nbed is rich in blood vessels, making it appear pink, except at the base, where a thick layer of epithelium over the nail\nmatrix forms a crescent-shaped region called the lunula (the “little moon”).

In this section, you will learn several of the most common skin conditions.\nDiseases\nOne of the most talked about diseases is skin cancer. Cancer is a broad term that describes diseases caused by\nabnormal cells in the body dividing uncontrollably. Most cancers are identified by the organ or tissue in which the\ncancer originates. One common form of cancer is skin cancer. The Skin Cancer Foundation reports that one in five\nAmericans will experience some type of skin cancer in their lifetime. The degradation of the ozone layer in the\natmosphere and the resulting increase in exposure to UV radiation has contributed to its rise. Overexposure to UV\nradiation damages DNA, which can lead to the formation of cancerous lesions. Although melanin offers some\nprotection against DNA damage from the sun, often it is not enough. The fact that cancers can also occur on areas of\nthe body that are normally not exposed to UV radiation suggests that there are additional factors that can lead to\ncancerous lesions.\nIn general, cancers result from an accumulation of DNA mutations. These mutations can result in cell populations\nthat do not die when they should and uncontrolled cell proliferation that leads to tumors. Although many tumors are\nbenign (harmless), some produce cells that can mobilize and establish tumors in other organs of the body; this\nprocess is referred to as metastasis. Cancers are characterized by their ability to metastasize.\nBasal Cell Carcinoma\nBasal cell carcinoma is a form of cancer that affects the mitotically active stem cells in the stratum basale of the\nThe accessory structures also have lowered activity, generating thinner hair and nails, and reduced amounts of\nsebum and sweat.

What is the function of the dermal papilla in the hair follicle?,"['The cells in the stratum basale bond to the\ndermis via intertwining collagen fibers, referred to as the basement membrane.

Dermal\npapillae increase the strength of the connection between the epidermis and dermis; the greater the folding, the\nstronger the connections made (Figure 5.5).\nFIGURE 5.5\nLayers of the Epidermis\nThe epidermis of thick skin has five layers: stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum\ngranulosum, stratum lucidum, and stratum corneum.\nThe stratum basale is a single layer of cells primarily made of basal cells. A basal cell is a cuboidal-shaped stem cell\n5.1 • Layers of the Skin\n165\nthat is a precursor of the keratinocytes of the epidermis. All of the keratinocytes are produced from this single layer\nof cells, which are constantly going through mitosis to produce new cells. As new cells are formed, the existing cells\nare pushed superficially away from the stratum basale. Two other cell types are found dispersed among the basal\ncells in the stratum basale. The first is a Merkel cell, which functions as a receptor and is responsible for stimulating\nsensory nerves that the brain perceives as touch. These cells are especially abundant on the surfaces of the hands\nand feet. The second is a melanocyte, a cell that produces the pigment melanin. Melanin gives hair and skin its\ncolor, and also helps protect the living cells of the epidermis from ultraviolet (UV) radiation damage.\nIn a growing fetus, fingerprints form where the cells of the stratum basale meet the papillae of the underlying\ndermal layer (papillary layer), resulting in the formation of the ridges on your fingers that you recognize as\nfingerprints. Fingerprints are unique to each individual and are used for forensic analyses because the patterns do\nnot change with the growth and aging processes.\nStratum Spinosum\nAs the name suggests, the stratum spinosum is spiny in appearance due to the protruding cell processes that join\nthe cells via a structure called a desmosome.', 'For this reason, our hair does not have sensation.\nFurthermore, you can cut your hair or shave without damaging the hair structure because the cut is superficial.

However, you\nalso breach this barrier when you choose to “accessorize” your skin with a tattoo or body piercing. Because the\nneedles involved in producing body art and piercings must penetrate the skin, there are dangers associated with\nthe practice. These include allergic reactions; skin infections; blood-borne diseases, such as tetanus, hepatitis\nC, and hepatitis D; and the growth of scar tissue.

The medulla forms the central core of the hair, which is surrounded by the cortex, a layer of\ncompressed, keratinized cells that is covered by an outer layer of very hard, keratinized cells known as the cuticle.\nThese layers are depicted in a longitudinal cross-section of the hair follicle (Figure 5.12), although not all hair has a\nmedullary layer. Hair texture (straight, curly) is determined by the shape and structure of the cortex, and to the\nextent that it is present, the medulla. The shape and structure of these layers are, in turn, determined by the shape\nof the hair follicle. Hair growth begins with the production of keratinocytes by the basal cells of the hair bulb.

These structures populate the landscape of\nour skin. (credit: the National Cancer Institute)\nDisorders of the...\nIntegumentary System\nThe first thing a clinician sees is the skin, and so the examination of the skin should be part of any thorough\nphysical examination. Most skin disorders are relatively benign, but a few, including melanomas, can be fatal if\nuntreated. A couple of the more noticeable disorders, albinism and vitiligo, affect the appearance of the skin and\nits accessory organs. Although neither is fatal, it would be hard to claim that they are benign, at least to the\nindividuals so afflicted.\nAlbinism is a genetic disorder that affects (completely or partially) the coloring of skin, hair, and eyes. The\ndefect is primarily due to the inability of melanocytes to produce melanin. Individuals with albinism tend to\nappear white or very pale due to the lack of melanin in their skin and hair. Recall that melanin helps protect the\nskin from the harmful effects of UV radiation. Individuals with albinism tend to need more protection from UV\nradiation, as they are more prone to sunburns and skin cancer. They also tend to be more sensitive to light and\nhave vision problems due to the lack of pigmentation on the retinal wall. Treatment of this disorder usually\ninvolves addressing the symptoms, such as limiting UV light exposure to the skin and eyes. In vitiligo, the\nmelanocytes in certain areas lose their ability to produce melanin, possibly due to an autoimmune reaction. This\nleads to a loss of color in patches (Figure 5.10).', '5.1 • Layers of the Skin\n169\nFIGURE 5.8\nSkin Pigmentation\nThe relative coloration of the skin depends of the amount of melanin produced by melanocytes in the\nstratum basale and taken up by keratinocytes.\nMelanin occurs in two primary forms. Eumelanin exists as black and brown, whereas pheomelanin provides a red\ncolor. Dark-skinned individuals produce more melanin than those with pale skin. Exposure to the UV rays of the sun\nor a tanning salon causes melanin to be manufactured and built up in keratinocytes, as sun exposure stimulates\nkeratinocytes to secrete chemicals that stimulate melanocytes. The accumulation of melanin in keratinocytes\nresults in the darkening of the skin, or a tan. This increased melanin accumulation protects the DNA of epidermal\ncells from UV ray damage and the breakdown of folic acid, a nutrient necessary for our health and well-being. In\ncontrast, too much melanin can interfere with the production of vitamin D, an important nutrient involved in calcium\nabsorption. Thus, the amount of melanin present in our skin is dependent on a balance between available sunlight\nand folic acid destruction, and protection from UV radiation and vitamin D production.\nIt requires about 10 days after initial sun exposure for melanin synthesis to peak, which is why pale-skinned\nindividuals tend to suffer sunburns of the epidermis initially. Dark-skinned individuals can also get sunburns, but are\nmore protected than are pale-skinned individuals. Melanosomes are temporary structures that are eventually\ndestroyed by fusion with lysosomes; this fact, along with melanin-filled keratinocytes in the stratum corneum\nsloughing off, makes tanning impermanent.\nToo much sun exposure can eventually lead to wrinkling due to the destruction of the cellular structure of the skin,\nand in severe cases, can cause sufficient DNA damage to result in skin cancer. When there is an irregular\naccumulation of melanocytes in the skin, freckles appear. Moles are larger masses of melanocytes, and although\nmost are benign, they should be monitored for changes that might indicate the presence of cancer (Figure 5.9).', 'These range from annoying\nbut relatively benign bacterial or fungal infections that are categorized as disorders, to skin cancer and severe burns,\nwhich can be fatal. In this section, you will learn several of the most common skin conditions.\nDiseases\nOne of the most talked about diseases is skin cancer. Cancer is a broad term that describes diseases caused by\nabnormal cells in the body dividing uncontrollably. Most cancers are identified by the organ or tissue in which the\ncancer originates. One common form of cancer is skin cancer. The Skin Cancer Foundation reports that one in five\nAmericans will experience some type of skin cancer in their lifetime. The degradation of the ozone layer in the\natmosphere and the resulting increase in exposure to UV radiation has contributed to its rise. Overexposure to UV\nradiation damages DNA, which can lead to the formation of cancerous lesions. Although melanin offers some\nprotection against DNA damage from the sun, often it is not enough. The fact that cancers can also occur on areas of\nthe body that are normally not exposed to UV radiation suggests that there are additional factors that can lead to\ncancerous lesions.\nIn general, cancers result from an accumulation of DNA mutations. These mutations can result in cell populations\nthat do not die when they should and uncontrolled cell proliferation that leads to tumors. Although many tumors are\nbenign (harmless), some produce cells that can mobilize and establish tumors in other organs of the body; this\nprocess is referred to as metastasis. Cancers are characterized by their ability to metastasize.\nBasal Cell Carcinoma\nBasal cell carcinoma is a form of cancer that affects the mitotically active stem cells in the stratum basale of the\nThe accessory structures also have lowered activity, generating thinner hair and nails, and reduced amounts of\nsebum and sweat. A reduced sweating ability can cause some elderly to be intolerant to extreme heat. Other\ncells in the skin, such as melanocytes and dendritic cells, also become less active, leading to a paler skin tone\nand lowered immunity. Wrinkling of the skin occurs due to breakdown of its structure, which results from\ndecreased collagen and elastin production in the dermis, weakening of muscles lying under the skin, and the\ninability of the skin to retain adequate moisture.', 'The hypodermis, with its fat\nstores, loses structure due to the reduction and redistribution of fat, which in turn contributes to the thinning\nand sagging of skin.\nFIGURE 5.17\nAging\nGenerally, skin, especially on the face and hands, starts to display the first noticeable signs of aging, as it loses\nits elasticity over time.

In the presence of\nsunlight, a form of vitamin D3 called cholecalciferol is synthesized from a derivative of the steroid cholesterol in the\nskin. The liver converts cholecalciferol to calcidiol, which is then converted to calcitriol (the active chemical form of\nthe vitamin) in the kidneys. Vitamin D is essential for normal absorption of calcium and phosphorous, which are\nrequired for healthy bones. The absence of sun exposure can lead to a lack of vitamin D in the body, leading to a\ncondition called rickets, a painful condition in children where the bones are misshapen due to a lack of calcium,\ncausing bowleggedness. Elderly individuals who suffer from vitamin D deficiency can develop a condition called\nosteomalacia, a softening of the bones. In present day society, vitamin D is added as a supplement to many foods,\nincluding milk and orange juice, compensating for the need for sun exposure.\nIn addition to its essential role in bone health, vitamin D is essential for general immunity against bacterial, viral,\nand fungal infections. Recent studies are also finding a link between insufficient vitamin D and cancer.\n5.4 Diseases, Disorders, and Injuries of the Integumentary System\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nDescribe several different diseases and disorders of the skin\n•\nDescribe the effect of injury to the skin and the process of healing\nThe integumentary system is susceptible to a variety of diseases, disorders, and injuries.

Among these\nchanges are reductions in cell division, metabolic activity, blood circulation, hormonal levels, and muscle\nstrength (Figure 5.17). In the skin, these changes are reflected in decreased mitosis in the stratum basale,\nleading to a thinner epidermis. The dermis, which is responsible for the elasticity and resilience of the skin,\nexhibits a reduced ability to regenerate, which leads to slower wound healing. The hypodermis, with its fat\nstores, loses structure due to the reduction and redistribution of fat, which in turn contributes to the thinning\nand sagging of skin.\nFIGURE 5.17\nAging\nGenerally, skin, especially on the face and hands, starts to display the first noticeable signs of aging, as it loses\nits elasticity over time.

Dermal\npapillae increase the strength of the connection between the epidermis and dermis; the greater the folding, the\nstronger the connections made (Figure 5.5).\nFIGURE 5.5\nLayers of the Epidermis\nThe epidermis of thick skin has five layers: stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum\ngranulosum, stratum lucidum, and stratum corneum.\nThe stratum basale is a single layer of cells primarily made of basal cells. A basal cell is a cuboidal-shaped stem cell\n5.1 • Layers of the Skin\n165\nthat is a precursor of the keratinocytes of the epidermis. All of the keratinocytes are produced from this single layer\nof cells, which are constantly going through mitosis to produce new cells. As new cells are formed, the existing cells\nare pushed superficially away from the stratum basale. Two other cell types are found dispersed among the basal\ncells in the stratum basale. The first is a Merkel cell, which functions as a receptor and is responsible for stimulating\nsensory nerves that the brain perceives as touch. These cells are especially abundant on the surfaces of the hands\nand feet. The second is a melanocyte, a cell that produces the pigment melanin. Melanin gives hair and skin its\ncolor, and also helps protect the living cells of the epidermis from ultraviolet (UV) radiation damage.\nIn a growing fetus, fingerprints form where the cells of the stratum basale meet the papillae of the underlying\ndermal layer (papillary layer), resulting in the formation of the ridges on your fingers that you recognize as\nfingerprints. Fingerprints are unique to each individual and are used for forensic analyses because the patterns do\nnot change with the growth and aging processes.\nStratum Spinosum\nAs the name suggests, the stratum spinosum is spiny in appearance due to the protruding cell processes that join\nthe cells via a structure called a desmosome.', 'In a growing fetus, fingerprints form where the cells of the stratum basale meet the papillae of the underlying\ndermal layer (papillary layer), resulting in the formation of the ridges on your fingers that you recognize as\nfingerprints.

The desmosomes interlock with each other and strengthen the bond\nbetween the cells. It is interesting to note that the “spiny” nature of this layer is an artifact of the staining process.\nUnstained epidermis samples do not exhibit this characteristic appearance. The stratum spinosum is composed of\neight to 10 layers of keratinocytes, formed as a result of cell division in the stratum basale (Figure 5.6). Interspersed\namong the keratinocytes of this layer is a type of dendritic cell called the Langerhans cell, which functions as a\nmacrophage by engulfing bacteria, foreign particles, and damaged cells that occur in this layer.\nFIGURE 5.6\nCells of the Epidermis\nThe cells in the different layers of the epidermis originate from basal cells located in the stratum\nbasale, yet the cells of each layer are distinctively different.

From top, LM × 40, LM × 40. (Micrographs provided by\nthe Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)\nThe cells in all of the layers except the stratum basale are called keratinocytes. A keratinocyte is a cell that\nmanufactures and stores the protein keratin. Keratin is an intracellular fibrous protein that gives hair, nails, and skin\ntheir hardness and water-resistant properties. The keratinocytes in the stratum corneum are dead and regularly\nslough away, being replaced by cells from the deeper layers (Figure 5.4).\n164\n5 • The Integumentary System\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFIGURE 5.4\nEpidermis\nThe epidermis is epithelium composed of multiple layers of cells.

As new keratinocytes are\nproduced atop the stratum basale, the keratinocytes of the stratum spinosum are pushed into the stratum\ngranulosum.\nStratum Granulosum\nThe stratum granulosum has a grainy appearance due to further changes to the keratinocytes as they are pushed\nfrom the stratum spinosum. The cells (three to five layers deep) become flatter, their cell membranes thicken, and\nthey generate large amounts of the proteins keratin, which is fibrous, and keratohyalin, which accumulates as\nlamellar granules within the cells (see Figure 5.5). These two proteins make up the bulk of the keratinocyte mass in\nthe stratum granulosum and give the layer its grainy appearance. The nuclei and other cell organelles disintegrate as\nthe cells die, leaving behind the keratin, keratohyalin, and cell membranes that will form the stratum lucidum, the\nstratum corneum, and the accessory structures of hair and nails.\nStratum Lucidum\nThe stratum lucidum is a smooth, seemingly translucent layer of the epidermis located just above the stratum\ngranulosum and below the stratum corneum. This thin layer of cells is found only in the thick skin of the palms,\nsoles, and digits. The keratinocytes that compose the stratum lucidum are dead and flattened (see Figure 5.5).\nThese cells are densely packed with eleidin, a clear protein, derived from keratohyalin, which gives these cells their\ntransparent (i.e., lucid) appearance.\nStratum Corneum\nThe stratum corneum is the most superficial layer of the epidermis and is the layer exposed to the outside\nenvironment (see Figure 5.5).', 'made\nof epidermal stem cells\nstratum corneum\nmost superficial layer of the\nepidermis\nstratum granulosum\nlayer of the epidermis\nsuperficial to the stratum spinosum\nstratum lucidum\nlayer of the epidermis between the\nstratum granulosum and stratum corneum, found\nonly in thick skin covering the palms, soles of the\nfeet, and digits\nstratum spinosum\nlayer of the epidermis superficial\nto the stratum basale, characterized by the\npresence of desmosomes\nstretch mark\nmark formed on the skin due to a\nsudden growth spurt and expansion of the dermis\nbeyond its elastic limits\nsudoriferous gland\nsweat gland\ntelogen\nresting phase of the hair growth cycle\ninitiated with catagen and terminated by the\nbeginning of a new anagen phase of hair growth\nthird-degree burn\nburn that penetrates and destroys\nthe full thickness of the skin (epidermis and dermis)\nvitamin D\ncompound that aids absorption of calcium\nand phosphates in the intestine to improve bone\nhealth\nvitiligo\nskin condition in which melanocytes in certain\nareas lose the ability to produce melanin, possibly\ndue an autoimmune reaction that leads to loss of\ncolor in patches\nChapter Review\n5.1 Layers of the Skin\nThe skin is composed of two major layers: a superficial\nepidermis and a deeper dermis. The epidermis consists\nof several layers beginning with the innermost\n(deepest) stratum basale (germinatum), followed by\nthe stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, stratum\nlucidum (when present), and ending with the\noutermost layer, the stratum corneum. The topmost\nlayer, the stratum corneum, consists of dead cells that\nshed periodically and is progressively replaced by cells\nformed from the basal layer. The stratum basale also\ncontains melanocytes, cells that produce melanin, the\npigment primarily responsible for giving skin its color.\nMelanin is transferred to keratinocytes in the stratum\nspinosum to protect cells from UV rays.']","Cells of the epidermis derive from basal cells located in the stratum basale, which continuously undergo mitosis to produce new keratinocytes.",Cells of the epidermis derive from stem cells of the stratum basale.
