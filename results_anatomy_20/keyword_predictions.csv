What is homeostasis?,"['Like most scientific disciplines, anatomy has areas of specialization. Gross anatomy is the study of the larger\nstructures of the body, those visible without the aid of magnification (Figure 1.2 a). Macro- means “large,” thus,\ngross anatomy is also referred to as macroscopic anatomy. In contrast, micro- means “small,” and microscopic\nanatomy is the study of structures that can be observed only with the use of a microscope or other magnification\ndevices (Figure 1.2 b). Microscopic anatomy includes cytology, the study of cells and histology, the study of tissues.\nAs the technology of microscopes has advanced, anatomists have been able to observe smaller and smaller\nstructures of the body, from slices of large structures like the heart, to the three-dimensional structures of large\nmolecules in the body.\nFIGURE 1.2\nGross and Microscopic Anatomy\n(a) Gross anatomy considers large structures such as the brain.

Regional\nanatomy is the study of the interrelationships of all of the structures in a specific body region, such as the abdomen.\nStudying regional anatomy helps us appreciate the interrelationships of body structures, such as how muscles,\nnerves, blood vessels, and other structures work together to serve a particular body region. In contrast, systemic\nanatomy is the study of the structures that make up a discrete body system—that is, a group of structures that work\ntogether to perform a unique body function. For example, a systemic anatomical study of the muscular system\nwould consider all of the skeletal muscles of the body.\nWhereas anatomy is about structure, physiology is about function. Human physiology is the scientific study of the\nchemistry and physics of the structures of the body and the ways in which they work together to support the\nfunctions of life. Much of the study of physiology centers on the body’s tendency toward homeostasis. Homeostasis\nis the state of steady internal conditions maintained by living things. The study of physiology certainly includes\nobservation, both with the naked eye and with microscopes, as well as manipulations and measurements. However,\ncurrent advances in physiology usually depend on carefully designed laboratory experiments that reveal the\n8\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nfunctions of the many structures and chemical compounds that make up the human body.\nLike anatomists, physiologists typically specialize in a particular branch of physiology. For example, neurophysiology\nis the study of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves and how these work together to perform functions as complex and\ndiverse as vision, movement, and thinking. Physiologists may work from the organ level (exploring, for example,\nwhat different parts of the brain do) to the molecular level (such as exploring how an electrochemical signal travels\nalong nerves).\nForm is closely related to function in all living things. For example, the thin flap of your eyelid can snap down to clear\naway dust particles and almost instantaneously slide back up to allow you to see again. At the microscopic level, the\narrangement and function of the nerves and muscles that serve the eyelid allow for its quick action and retreat. At a\nsmaller level of analysis, the function of these nerves and muscles likewise relies on the interactions of specific\nmolecules and ions. Even the three-dimensional structure of certain molecules is essential to their function.\nYour study of anatomy and physiology will make more sense if you continually relate the form of the structures you\nare studying to their function. In fact, it can be somewhat frustrating to attempt to study anatomy without an\nunderstanding of the physiology that a body structure supports. Imagine, for example, trying to appreciate the\nunique arrangement of the bones of the human hand if you had no conception of the function of the hand.\nFortunately, your understanding of how the human hand manipulates tools—from pens to cell phones—helps you\nappreciate the unique alignment of the thumb in opposition to the four fingers, making your hand a structure that\nallows you to pinch and grasp objects and type text messages.', 'Pedagogical Foundation and Features\nAnatomy and Physiology 2e is designed to promote\nscientific literacy.

An\nunderstanding of anatomy and physiology is not only fundamental to any career in the health professions, but it can\nalso benefit your own health. Familiarity with the human body can help you make healthful choices and prompt you\nto take appropriate action when signs of illness arise. Your knowledge in this field will help you understand news\nabout nutrition, medications, medical devices, and procedures and help you understand genetic or infectious\ndiseases. At some point, everyone will have a problem with some aspect of their body and your knowledge can help\nyou to be a better parent, spouse, partner, friend, colleague, or caregiver.\nThis chapter begins with an overview of anatomy and physiology and a preview of the body regions and functions. It\nthen covers the characteristics of life and how the body works to maintain stable conditions. It introduces a set of\nstandard terms for body structures and for planes and positions in the body that will serve as a foundation for more\ncomprehensive information covered later in the text. It ends with examples of medical imaging used to see inside\nthe living body.\nFigure 1.1\nBlood Pressure A proficiency in anatomy and physiology is fundamental to any career in the health professions.

Some of these structures are very small and can\nonly be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a microscope. Other larger structures can readily be seen,\nmanipulated, measured, and weighed. The word “anatomy” comes from a Greek root that means “to cut apart.”\nHuman anatomy was first studied by observing the exterior of the body and observing the wounds of soldiers and\nother injuries. Later, physicians were allowed to dissect bodies of the dead to augment their knowledge. When a\nbody is dissected, its structures are cut apart in order to observe their physical attributes and their relationships to\none another. Dissection is still used in medical schools, anatomy courses, and in pathology labs. In order to observe\nstructures in living people, however, a number of imaging techniques have been developed. These techniques allow\nclinicians to visualize structures inside the living body such as a cancerous tumor or a fractured bone.\nLike most scientific disciplines, anatomy has areas of specialization. Gross anatomy is the study of the larger\nstructures of the body, those visible without the aid of magnification (Figure 1.2 a). Macro- means “large,” thus,\ngross anatomy is also referred to as macroscopic anatomy. In contrast, micro- means “small,” and microscopic\nanatomy is the study of structures that can be observed only with the use of a microscope or other magnification\ndevices (Figure 1.2 b). Microscopic anatomy includes cytology, the study of cells and histology, the study of tissues.\nAs the technology of microscopes has advanced, anatomists have been able to observe smaller and smaller\nstructures of the body, from slices of large structures like the heart, to the three-dimensional structures of large\nmolecules in the body.\nFIGURE 1.2\nGross and Microscopic Anatomy\n(a) Gross anatomy considers large structures such as the brain.

Some of these structures are very small and can\nonly be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a microscope. Other larger structures can readily be seen,\nmanipulated, measured, and weighed. The word “anatomy” comes from a Greek root that means “to cut apart.”\nHuman anatomy was first studied by observing the exterior of the body and observing the wounds of soldiers and\nother injuries. Later, physicians were allowed to dissect bodies of the dead to augment their knowledge. When a\nbody is dissected, its structures are cut apart in order to observe their physical attributes and their relationships to\none another. Dissection is still used in medical schools, anatomy courses, and in pathology labs. In order to observe\nstructures in living people, however, a number of imaging techniques have been developed. These techniques allow\nclinicians to visualize structures inside the living body such as a cancerous tumor or a fractured bone.\nLike most scientific disciplines, anatomy has areas of specialization. Gross anatomy is the study of the larger\nstructures of the body, those visible without the aid of magnification (Figure 1.2 a). Macro- means “large,” thus,\ngross anatomy is also referred to as macroscopic anatomy. In contrast, micro- means “small,” and microscopic\nanatomy is the study of structures that can be observed only with the use of a microscope or other magnification\ndevices (Figure 1.2 b). Microscopic anatomy includes cytology, the study of cells and histology, the study of tissues.\nAs the technology of microscopes has advanced, anatomists have been able to observe smaller and smaller\nstructures of the body, from slices of large structures like the heart, to the three-dimensional structures of large\nmolecules in the body.\nFIGURE 1.2\nGross and Microscopic Anatomy\n(a) Gross anatomy considers large structures such as the brain.

(credit a:\n“WriterHound”/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)\nAnatomists take two general approaches to the study of the body’s structures: regional and systemic. Regional\nanatomy is the study of the interrelationships of all of the structures in a specific body region, such as the abdomen.\nStudying regional anatomy helps us appreciate the interrelationships of body structures, such as how muscles,\nnerves, blood vessels, and other structures work together to serve a particular body region. In contrast, systemic\nanatomy is the study of the structures that make up a discrete body system—that is, a group of structures that work\ntogether to perform a unique body function. For example, a systemic anatomical study of the muscular system\nwould consider all of the skeletal muscles of the body.\nWhereas anatomy is about structure, physiology is about function. Human physiology is the scientific study of the\nchemistry and physics of the structures of the body and the ways in which they work together to support the\nfunctions of life. Much of the study of physiology centers on the body’s tendency toward homeostasis. Homeostasis\nis the state of steady internal conditions maintained by living things. The study of physiology certainly includes\nobservation, both with the naked eye and with microscopes, as well as manipulations and measurements. However,\ncurrent advances in physiology usually depend on carefully designed laboratory experiments that reveal the\n8\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nfunctions of the many structures and chemical compounds that make up the human body.\nLike anatomists, physiologists typically specialize in a particular branch of physiology. For example, neurophysiology\nis the study of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves and how these work together to perform functions as complex and\ndiverse as vision, movement, and thinking. Physiologists may work from the organ level (exploring, for example,\nwhat different parts of the brain do) to the molecular level (such as exploring how an electrochemical signal travels\nalong nerves).\nForm is closely related to function in all living things. For example, the thin flap of your eyelid can snap down to clear\naway dust particles and almost instantaneously slide back up to allow you to see again. At the microscopic level, the\narrangement and function of the nerves and muscles that serve the eyelid allow for its quick action and retreat. At a\nsmaller level of analysis, the function of these nerves and muscles likewise relies on the interactions of specific\nmolecules and ions. Even the three-dimensional structure of certain molecules is essential to their function.\nYour study of anatomy and physiology will make more sense if you continually relate the form of the structures you\nare studying to their function. In fact, it can be somewhat frustrating to attempt to study anatomy without an\nunderstanding of the physiology that a body structure supports. Imagine, for example, trying to appreciate the\nunique arrangement of the bones of the human hand if you had no conception of the function of the hand.\nFortunately, your understanding of how the human hand manipulates tools—from pens to cell phones—helps you\nappreciate the unique alignment of the thumb in opposition to the four fingers, making your hand a structure that\nallows you to pinch and grasp objects and type text messages.', 'Pedagogical Foundation and Features\nAnatomy and Physiology 2e is designed to promote\nscientific literacy.

Microscopic anatomy includes cytology, the study of cells and histology, the study of tissues.\nAs the technology of microscopes has advanced, anatomists have been able to observe smaller and smaller\nstructures of the body, from slices of large structures like the heart, to the three-dimensional structures of large\nmolecules in the body.\nFIGURE 1.2\nGross and Microscopic Anatomy\n(a) Gross anatomy considers large structures such as the brain.

(credit a:\n“WriterHound”/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)\nAnatomists take two general approaches to the study of the body’s structures: regional and systemic. Regional\nanatomy is the study of the interrelationships of all of the structures in a specific body region, such as the abdomen.\nStudying regional anatomy helps us appreciate the interrelationships of body structures, such as how muscles,\nnerves, blood vessels, and other structures work together to serve a particular body region. In contrast, systemic\nanatomy is the study of the structures that make up a discrete body system—that is, a group of structures that work\ntogether to perform a unique body function. For example, a systemic anatomical study of the muscular system\nwould consider all of the skeletal muscles of the body.\nWhereas anatomy is about structure, physiology is about function. Human physiology is the scientific study of the\nchemistry and physics of the structures of the body and the ways in which they work together to support the\nfunctions of life. Much of the study of physiology centers on the body’s tendency toward homeostasis. Homeostasis\nis the state of steady internal conditions maintained by living things. The study of physiology certainly includes\nobservation, both with the naked eye and with microscopes, as well as manipulations and measurements. However,\ncurrent advances in physiology usually depend on carefully designed laboratory experiments that reveal the\n8\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nfunctions of the many structures and chemical compounds that make up the human body.\nLike anatomists, physiologists typically specialize in a particular branch of physiology. For example, neurophysiology\nis the study of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves and how these work together to perform functions as complex and\ndiverse as vision, movement, and thinking. Physiologists may work from the organ level (exploring, for example,\nwhat different parts of the brain do) to the molecular level (such as exploring how an electrochemical signal travels\nalong nerves).\nForm is closely related to function in all living things. For example, the thin flap of your eyelid can snap down to clear\naway dust particles and almost instantaneously slide back up to allow you to see again. At the microscopic level, the\narrangement and function of the nerves and muscles that serve the eyelid allow for its quick action and retreat. At a\nsmaller level of analysis, the function of these nerves and muscles likewise relies on the interactions of specific\nmolecules and ions. Even the three-dimensional structure of certain molecules is essential to their function.\nYour study of anatomy and physiology will make more sense if you continually relate the form of the structures you\nare studying to their function. In fact, it can be somewhat frustrating to attempt to study anatomy without an\nunderstanding of the physiology that a body structure supports. Imagine, for example, trying to appreciate the\nunique arrangement of the bones of the human hand if you had no conception of the function of the hand.\nFortunately, your understanding of how the human hand manipulates tools—from pens to cell phones—helps you\nappreciate the unique alignment of the thumb in opposition to the four fingers, making your hand a structure that\nallows you to pinch and grasp objects and type text messages.', 'Preface\n5\n6\nPreface\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nINTRODUCTION\nCHAPTER 1\nAn Introduction to the Human Body\nCHAPTER OBJECTIVES\nAfter studying this chapter, you will be able to:\n•\nDistinguish between anatomy and physiology, and identify several branches of each\n•\nDescribe the structure of the body, from simplest to most complex, in terms of the six levels of organization\n•\nIdentify the functional characteristics of human life\n•\nIdentify the four requirements for human survival\n•\nDefine homeostasis and explain its importance to normal human functioning\n•\nUse appropriate anatomical terminology to identify key body structures, body regions, and directions in the\nbody\n•\nCompare and contrast at least four medical imaging techniques in terms of their function and use in\nmedicine\nThough you may approach a course in anatomy and physiology strictly as a requirement for your\nfield of study, the knowledge you gain in this course will serve you well in many aspects of your life. An\nunderstanding of anatomy and physiology is not only fundamental to any career in the health professions, but it can\nalso benefit your own health. Familiarity with the human body can help you make healthful choices and prompt you\nto take appropriate action when signs of illness arise. Your knowledge in this field will help you understand news\nabout nutrition, medications, medical devices, and procedures and help you understand genetic or infectious\ndiseases. At some point, everyone will have a problem with some aspect of their body and your knowledge can help\nyou to be a better parent, spouse, partner, friend, colleague, or caregiver.\nThis chapter begins with an overview of anatomy and physiology and a preview of the body regions and functions. It\nthen covers the characteristics of life and how the body works to maintain stable conditions. It introduces a set of\nstandard terms for body structures and for planes and positions in the body that will serve as a foundation for more\ncomprehensive information covered later in the text. It ends with examples of medical imaging used to see inside\nthe living body.\nFigure 1.1\nBlood Pressure A proficiency in anatomy and physiology is fundamental to any career in the health professions. (credit: Bryan\nMason/flickr)\n1.1 Overview of Anatomy and Physiology\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nCompare and contrast anatomy and physiology, including their specializations and methods of study\n•\nDiscuss the fundamental relationship between anatomy and physiology\nHuman anatomy is the scientific study of the body’s structures. Some of these structures are very small and can\nonly be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a microscope. Other larger structures can readily be seen,\nmanipulated, measured, and weighed. The word “anatomy” comes from a Greek root that means “to cut apart.”\nHuman anatomy was first studied by observing the exterior of the body and observing the wounds of soldiers and\nother injuries. Later, physicians were allowed to dissect bodies of the dead to augment their knowledge. When a\nbody is dissected, its structures are cut apart in order to observe their physical attributes and their relationships to\none another. Dissection is still used in medical schools, anatomy courses, and in pathology labs. In order to observe\nstructures in living people, however, a number of imaging techniques have been developed. These techniques allow\nclinicians to visualize structures inside the living body such as a cancerous tumor or a fractured bone.\nLike most scientific disciplines, anatomy has areas of specialization. Gross anatomy is the study of the larger\nstructures of the body, those visible without the aid of magnification (Figure 1.2 a). Macro- means “large,” thus,\ngross anatomy is also referred to as macroscopic anatomy. In contrast, micro- means “small,” and microscopic\nanatomy is the study of structures that can be observed only with the use of a microscope or other magnification\ndevices (Figure 1.2 b). Microscopic anatomy includes cytology, the study of cells and histology, the study of tissues.\nAs the technology of microscopes has advanced, anatomists have been able to observe smaller and smaller\nstructures of the body, from slices of large structures like the heart, to the three-dimensional structures of large\nmolecules in the body.\nFIGURE 1.2\nGross and Microscopic Anatomy\n(a) Gross anatomy considers large structures such as the brain.

It is convenient to consider the\nstructures of the body in terms of fundamental levels of organization that increase in complexity: subatomic\nparticles, atoms, molecules, organelles, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms and biosphere (Figure 1.3).\n1.2 • Structural Organization of the Human Body\n9']","The primary goal of ""Anatomy and Physiology 2e"" is to promote scientific literacy and engage students by providing a comprehensive understanding of human anatomy and physiology, emphasizing the relationship between structure and function, and preparing them for careers in health professions.","The primary goal of this textbook is to make the discipline engaging and relevant to students, so that they can draw from it a working knowledge that will enrich their future studies and support them in their careers."

The development choices for this textbook\nwere guided by hundreds of faculty who are deeply\ninvolved in teaching this course, as well as instructional\ndesigners, academic success experts, and educational\nresearchers who have supported A&P educators and\nstudents. These choices led to innovations in art,\nterminology, career orientation, practical applications,\nand multimedia-based learning, all with a goal of\nincreasing relevance to students. We strove to make\nthe discipline engaging and relevant to students, so\nthat they can draw from it a working knowledge that\nwill enrich their future studies and support them in\ntheir careers.\nUnit 1: Levels of Organization\nChapters 1–4 provide students with a basic\nunderstanding of human anatomy and physiology,\nincluding its language, the levels of organization, and\nthe basics of chemistry and cell biology. These\nchapters provide a foundation for the further study of\nthe body. They also focus particularly on how the\nbody’s regions, important chemicals, and cells\nmaintain homeostasis.\nChapter 1 An Introduction to the Human Body\nChapter 2 The Chemical Level of Organization\nChapter 3 The Cellular Level of Organization\nChapter 4 The Tissue Level of Organization\nUnit 2: Support and Movement\nIn Chapters 5–11, students explore the skin, the\nlargest organ of the body, and examine the body’s\nskeletal and muscular systems, following a traditional\nsequence of topics. This unit is the first to walk\nstudents through specific systems of the body, and as it\ndoes so, it maintains a focus on homeostasis as well as\nthose diseases and conditions that can disrupt it.\nChapter 5 The Integumentary System\nChapter 6 Bone and Skeletal Tissue\nChapter 7 The Axial Skeleton\nChapter 8 The Appendicular Skeleton\nChapter 9 Joints\nChapter 10 Muscle Tissue\nChapter 11 The Muscular System\nUnit 3: Regulation, Integration, and Control\nChapters 12–17 help students answer questions about\nPreface\n1\nnervous and endocrine system control and regulation.\nIn a break with the traditional sequence of topics, the\nspecial senses are integrated into the chapter on the\nsomatic nervous system. The chapter on the\nneurological examination offers students a unique\napproach to understanding nervous system function\nusing five simple but powerful diagnostic tests.\nChapter 12 Introduction to the Nervous System\nChapter 13 The Anatomy of the Nervous System\nChapter 14 The Somatic Nervous System\nChapter 15 The Autonomic Nervous System\nChapter 16 The Neurological Exam\nChapter 17 The Endocrine System\nUnit 4: Fluids and Transport\nIn Chapters 18–21, students examine the principal\nmeans of transport for materials needed to support the\nhuman body, regulate its internal environment, and\nprovide protection.\nChapter 18 Blood\nChapter 19 The Cardiovascular System: The Heart\nChapter 20 The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels\nand Circulation\nChapter 21 The Lymphatic System and Immunity\nUnit 5: Energy, Maintenance, and Environmental\nExchange\nIn Chapters 22–26, students discover the interaction\nbetween body systems and the outside environment\nfor the exchange of materials, the capture of energy,\nthe release of waste, and the overall maintenance of\nthe internal systems that regulate the exchange. The\nexplanations and illustrations are particularly focused\non how structure relates to function.', 'Like most scientific disciplines, anatomy has areas of specialization. Gross anatomy is the study of the larger\nstructures of the body, those visible without the aid of magnification (Figure 1.2 a). Macro- means “large,” thus,\ngross anatomy is also referred to as macroscopic anatomy. In contrast, micro- means “small,” and microscopic\nanatomy is the study of structures that can be observed only with the use of a microscope or other magnification\ndevices (Figure 1.2 b). Microscopic anatomy includes cytology, the study of cells and histology, the study of tissues.\nAs the technology of microscopes has advanced, anatomists have been able to observe smaller and smaller\nstructures of the body, from slices of large structures like the heart, to the three-dimensional structures of large\nmolecules in the body.\nFIGURE 1.2\nGross and Microscopic Anatomy\n(a) Gross anatomy considers large structures such as the brain.

(credit a:\n“WriterHound”/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)\nAnatomists take two general approaches to the study of the body’s structures: regional and systemic. Regional\nanatomy is the study of the interrelationships of all of the structures in a specific body region, such as the abdomen.\nStudying regional anatomy helps us appreciate the interrelationships of body structures, such as how muscles,\nnerves, blood vessels, and other structures work together to serve a particular body region. In contrast, systemic\nanatomy is the study of the structures that make up a discrete body system—that is, a group of structures that work\ntogether to perform a unique body function. For example, a systemic anatomical study of the muscular system\nwould consider all of the skeletal muscles of the body.\nWhereas anatomy is about structure, physiology is about function. Human physiology is the scientific study of the\nchemistry and physics of the structures of the body and the ways in which they work together to support the\nfunctions of life. Much of the study of physiology centers on the body’s tendency toward homeostasis. Homeostasis\nis the state of steady internal conditions maintained by living things. The study of physiology certainly includes\nobservation, both with the naked eye and with microscopes, as well as manipulations and measurements. However,\ncurrent advances in physiology usually depend on carefully designed laboratory experiments that reveal the\n8\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nfunctions of the many structures and chemical compounds that make up the human body.\nLike anatomists, physiologists typically specialize in a particular branch of physiology. For example, neurophysiology\nis the study of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves and how these work together to perform functions as complex and\ndiverse as vision, movement, and thinking. Physiologists may work from the organ level (exploring, for example,\nwhat different parts of the brain do) to the molecular level (such as exploring how an electrochemical signal travels\nalong nerves).\nForm is closely related to function in all living things. For example, the thin flap of your eyelid can snap down to clear\naway dust particles and almost instantaneously slide back up to allow you to see again. At the microscopic level, the\narrangement and function of the nerves and muscles that serve the eyelid allow for its quick action and retreat. At a\nsmaller level of analysis, the function of these nerves and muscles likewise relies on the interactions of specific\nmolecules and ions. Even the three-dimensional structure of certain molecules is essential to their function.\nYour study of anatomy and physiology will make more sense if you continually relate the form of the structures you\nare studying to their function. In fact, it can be somewhat frustrating to attempt to study anatomy without an\nunderstanding of the physiology that a body structure supports. Imagine, for example, trying to appreciate the\nunique arrangement of the bones of the human hand if you had no conception of the function of the hand.\nFortunately, your understanding of how the human hand manipulates tools—from pens to cell phones—helps you\nappreciate the unique alignment of the thumb in opposition to the four fingers, making your hand a structure that\nallows you to pinch and grasp objects and type text messages.', 'For example, the thin flap of your eyelid can snap down to clear\naway dust particles and almost instantaneously slide back up to allow you to see again.

It is convenient to consider the\nstructures of the body in terms of fundamental levels of organization that increase in complexity: subatomic\nparticles, atoms, molecules, organelles, cells, tissues, organs, organ systems, organisms and biosphere (Figure 1.3).\n1.2 • Structural Organization of the Human Body\n9', 'Chapter 12 Introduction to the Nervous System\nChapter 13 The Anatomy of the Nervous System\nChapter 14 The Somatic Nervous System\nChapter 15 The Autonomic Nervous System\nChapter 16 The Neurological Exam\nChapter 17 The Endocrine System\nUnit 4: Fluids and Transport\nIn Chapters 18–21, students examine the principal\nmeans of transport for materials needed to support the\nhuman body, regulate its internal environment, and\nprovide protection.\nChapter 18 Blood\nChapter 19 The Cardiovascular System: The Heart\nChapter 20 The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels\nand Circulation\nChapter 21 The Lymphatic System and Immunity\nUnit 5: Energy, Maintenance, and Environmental\nExchange\nIn Chapters 22–26, students discover the interaction\nbetween body systems and the outside environment\nfor the exchange of materials, the capture of energy,\nthe release of waste, and the overall maintenance of\nthe internal systems that regulate the exchange.

An\nunderstanding of anatomy and physiology is not only fundamental to any career in the health professions, but it can\nalso benefit your own health. Familiarity with the human body can help you make healthful choices and prompt you\nto take appropriate action when signs of illness arise. Your knowledge in this field will help you understand news\nabout nutrition, medications, medical devices, and procedures and help you understand genetic or infectious\ndiseases. At some point, everyone will have a problem with some aspect of their body and your knowledge can help\nyou to be a better parent, spouse, partner, friend, colleague, or caregiver.\nThis chapter begins with an overview of anatomy and physiology and a preview of the body regions and functions. It\nthen covers the characteristics of life and how the body works to maintain stable conditions. It introduces a set of\nstandard terms for body structures and for planes and positions in the body that will serve as a foundation for more\ncomprehensive information covered later in the text. It ends with examples of medical imaging used to see inside\nthe living body.\nFigure 1.1\nBlood Pressure A proficiency in anatomy and physiology is fundamental to any career in the health professions.

Some of these structures are very small and can\nonly be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a microscope. Other larger structures can readily be seen,\nmanipulated, measured, and weighed. The word “anatomy” comes from a Greek root that means “to cut apart.”\nHuman anatomy was first studied by observing the exterior of the body and observing the wounds of soldiers and\nother injuries. Later, physicians were allowed to dissect bodies of the dead to augment their knowledge. When a\nbody is dissected, its structures are cut apart in order to observe their physical attributes and their relationships to\none another. Dissection is still used in medical schools, anatomy courses, and in pathology labs. In order to observe\nstructures in living people, however, a number of imaging techniques have been developed. These techniques allow\nclinicians to visualize structures inside the living body such as a cancerous tumor or a fractured bone.\nLike most scientific disciplines, anatomy has areas of specialization. Gross anatomy is the study of the larger\nstructures of the body, those visible without the aid of magnification (Figure 1.2 a). Macro- means “large,” thus,\ngross anatomy is also referred to as macroscopic anatomy.

We\nstrongly urge students to explore these links,\nwhether viewing a video or inputting data into a\nsimulation, to gain the fullest experience and to\nlearn how to search for information independently.\nDynamic, Learner-Centered Art\nOur unique approach to visuals is designed to\nemphasize only the components most important in any\ngiven illustration. The art style is particularly aimed at\nfocusing student learning through a powerful blend of\ntraditional depictions and instructional innovations.\nMuch of the art in this book consists of black line\nillustrations. The strongest line is used to highlight the\nmost important structures, and shading is used to\nshow dimension and shape. Color is used sparingly to\nhighlight and clarify the primary anatomical or\nfunctional point of the illustration. This technique is\nintended to draw students’ attention to the critical\nlearning point in the illustration, without distraction\nfrom excessive gradients, shadows, and highlights. Full\ncolor is used when the structure or process requires it\n(for example, muscle diagrams and cardiovascular\nsystem illustrations).\nBy highlighting the most important portions of the\nillustration, the artwork helps students focus on the\nmost important points without overwhelming them.\nMicrographs\nMicrograph magnifications have been calculated based\non the objective provided with the image. If a\nmicrograph was recorded at 40×, and the image was\nmagnified an additional 2×, we calculated the final\nmagnification of the micrograph to be 80×.\nPlease note that, when viewing the textbook\nelectronically, the micrograph magnification provided\nin the text does not take into account the size and\nmagnification of the screen on your electronic device.\nThere may be some variation.\nThese glands secrete oils that lubricate and protect the\nskin.

The development choices for this textbook\nwere guided by hundreds of faculty who are deeply\ninvolved in teaching this course, as well as instructional\ndesigners, academic success experts, and educational\nresearchers who have supported A&P educators and\nstudents. These choices led to innovations in art,\nterminology, career orientation, practical applications,\nand multimedia-based learning, all with a goal of\nincreasing relevance to students. We strove to make\nthe discipline engaging and relevant to students, so\nthat they can draw from it a working knowledge that\nwill enrich their future studies and support them in\ntheir careers.\nUnit 1: Levels of Organization\nChapters 1–4 provide students with a basic\nunderstanding of human anatomy and physiology,\nincluding its language, the levels of organization, and\nthe basics of chemistry and cell biology.

An\nunderstanding of anatomy and physiology is not only fundamental to any career in the health professions, but it can\nalso benefit your own health. Familiarity with the human body can help you make healthful choices and prompt you\nto take appropriate action when signs of illness arise. Your knowledge in this field will help you understand news\nabout nutrition, medications, medical devices, and procedures and help you understand genetic or infectious\ndiseases. At some point, everyone will have a problem with some aspect of their body and your knowledge can help\nyou to be a better parent, spouse, partner, friend, colleague, or caregiver.\nThis chapter begins with an overview of anatomy and physiology and a preview of the body regions and functions. It\nthen covers the characteristics of life and how the body works to maintain stable conditions. It introduces a set of\nstandard terms for body structures and for planes and positions in the body that will serve as a foundation for more\ncomprehensive information covered later in the text. It ends with examples of medical imaging used to see inside\nthe living body.\nFigure 1.1\nBlood Pressure A proficiency in anatomy and physiology is fundamental to any career in the health professions. (credit: Bryan\nMason/flickr)\n1.1 Overview of Anatomy and Physiology\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\n•\nCompare and contrast anatomy and physiology, including their specializations and methods of study\n•\nDiscuss the fundamental relationship between anatomy and physiology\nHuman anatomy is the scientific study of the body’s structures. Some of these structures are very small and can\nonly be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a microscope. Other larger structures can readily be seen,\nmanipulated, measured, and weighed. The word “anatomy” comes from a Greek root that means “to cut apart.”\nHuman anatomy was first studied by observing the exterior of the body and observing the wounds of soldiers and\nother injuries. Later, physicians were allowed to dissect bodies of the dead to augment their knowledge. When a\nbody is dissected, its structures are cut apart in order to observe their physical attributes and their relationships to\none another. Dissection is still used in medical schools, anatomy courses, and in pathology labs. In order to observe\nstructures in living people, however, a number of imaging techniques have been developed. These techniques allow\nclinicians to visualize structures inside the living body such as a cancerous tumor or a fractured bone.\nLike most scientific disciplines, anatomy has areas of specialization. Gross anatomy is the study of the larger\nstructures of the body, those visible without the aid of magnification (Figure 1.2 a). Macro- means “large,” thus,\ngross anatomy is also referred to as macroscopic anatomy. In contrast, micro- means “small,” and microscopic\nanatomy is the study of structures that can be observed only with the use of a microscope or other magnification\ndevices (Figure 1.2 b). Microscopic anatomy includes cytology, the study of cells and histology, the study of tissues.\nAs the technology of microscopes has advanced, anatomists have been able to observe smaller and smaller\nstructures of the body, from slices of large structures like the heart, to the three-dimensional structures of large\nmolecules in the body.\nFIGURE 1.2\nGross and Microscopic Anatomy\n(a) Gross anatomy considers large structures such as the brain. (b) Microscopic anatomy\ncan deal with the same structures, though at a different scale. This is a micrograph of nerve cells from the brain.

(credit a:\n“WriterHound”/Wikimedia Commons; credit b: Micrograph provided by the Regents of University of Michigan Medical School © 2012)\nAnatomists take two general approaches to the study of the body’s structures: regional and systemic. Regional\nanatomy is the study of the interrelationships of all of the structures in a specific body region, such as the abdomen.\nStudying regional anatomy helps us appreciate the interrelationships of body structures, such as how muscles,\nnerves, blood vessels, and other structures work together to serve a particular body region. In contrast, systemic\nanatomy is the study of the structures that make up a discrete body system—that is, a group of structures that work\ntogether to perform a unique body function. For example, a systemic anatomical study of the muscular system\nwould consider all of the skeletal muscles of the body.\nWhereas anatomy is about structure, physiology is about function. Human physiology is the scientific study of the\nchemistry and physics of the structures of the body and the ways in which they work together to support the\nfunctions of life. Much of the study of physiology centers on the body’s tendency toward homeostasis. Homeostasis\nis the state of steady internal conditions maintained by living things. The study of physiology certainly includes\nobservation, both with the naked eye and with microscopes, as well as manipulations and measurements. However,\ncurrent advances in physiology usually depend on carefully designed laboratory experiments that reveal the\n8\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nfunctions of the many structures and chemical compounds that make up the human body.\nLike anatomists, physiologists typically specialize in a particular branch of physiology. For example, neurophysiology\nis the study of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves and how these work together to perform functions as complex and\ndiverse as vision, movement, and thinking. Physiologists may work from the organ level (exploring, for example,\nwhat different parts of the brain do) to the molecular level (such as exploring how an electrochemical signal travels\nalong nerves).\nForm is closely related to function in all living things. For example, the thin flap of your eyelid can snap down to clear\naway dust particles and almost instantaneously slide back up to allow you to see again. At the microscopic level, the\narrangement and function of the nerves and muscles that serve the eyelid allow for its quick action and retreat. At a\nsmaller level of analysis, the function of these nerves and muscles likewise relies on the interactions of specific\nmolecules and ions.

An\nunderstanding of anatomy and physiology is not only fundamental to any career in the health professions, but it can\nalso benefit your own health. Familiarity with the human body can help you make healthful choices and prompt you\nto take appropriate action when signs of illness arise. Your knowledge in this field will help you understand news\nabout nutrition, medications, medical devices, and procedures and help you understand genetic or infectious\ndiseases. At some point, everyone will have a problem with some aspect of their body and your knowledge can help\nyou to be a better parent, spouse, partner, friend, colleague, or caregiver.\nThis chapter begins with an overview of anatomy and physiology and a preview of the body regions and functions. It\nthen covers the characteristics of life and how the body works to maintain stable conditions. It introduces a set of\nstandard terms for body structures and for planes and positions in the body that will serve as a foundation for more\ncomprehensive information covered later in the text. It ends with examples of medical imaging used to see inside\nthe living body.\nFigure 1.1\nBlood Pressure A proficiency in anatomy and physiology is fundamental to any career in the health professions.

Some of these structures are very small and can\nonly be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a microscope. Other larger structures can readily be seen,\nmanipulated, measured, and weighed. The word “anatomy” comes from a Greek root that means “to cut apart.”\nHuman anatomy was first studied by observing the exterior of the body and observing the wounds of soldiers and\nother injuries. Later, physicians were allowed to dissect bodies of the dead to augment their knowledge. When a\nbody is dissected, its structures are cut apart in order to observe their physical attributes and their relationships to\none another. Dissection is still used in medical schools, anatomy courses, and in pathology labs. In order to observe\nstructures in living people, however, a number of imaging techniques have been developed. These techniques allow\nclinicians to visualize structures inside the living body such as a cancerous tumor or a fractured bone.\nLike most scientific disciplines, anatomy has areas of specialization. Gross anatomy is the study of the larger\nstructures of the body, those visible without the aid of magnification (Figure 1.2 a). Macro- means “large,” thus,\ngross anatomy is also referred to as macroscopic anatomy. In contrast, micro- means “small,” and microscopic\nanatomy is the study of structures that can be observed only with the use of a microscope or other magnification\ndevices (Figure 1.2 b). Microscopic anatomy includes cytology, the study of cells and histology, the study of tissues.\nAs the technology of microscopes has advanced, anatomists have been able to observe smaller and smaller\nstructures of the body, from slices of large structures like the heart, to the three-dimensional structures of large\nmolecules in the body.\nFIGURE 1.2\nGross and Microscopic Anatomy\n(a) Gross anatomy considers large structures such as the brain.

Regional\nanatomy is the study of the interrelationships of all of the structures in a specific body region, such as the abdomen.\nStudying regional anatomy helps us appreciate the interrelationships of body structures, such as how muscles,\nnerves, blood vessels, and other structures work together to serve a particular body region. In contrast, systemic\nanatomy is the study of the structures that make up a discrete body system—that is, a group of structures that work\ntogether to perform a unique body function. For example, a systemic anatomical study of the muscular system\nwould consider all of the skeletal muscles of the body.\nWhereas anatomy is about structure, physiology is about function. Human physiology is the scientific study of the\nchemistry and physics of the structures of the body and the ways in which they work together to support the\nfunctions of life. Much of the study of physiology centers on the body’s tendency toward homeostasis. Homeostasis\nis the state of steady internal conditions maintained by living things. The study of physiology certainly includes\nobservation, both with the naked eye and with microscopes, as well as manipulations and measurements. However,\ncurrent advances in physiology usually depend on carefully designed laboratory experiments that reveal the\n8\n1 • An Introduction to the Human Body\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nfunctions of the many structures and chemical compounds that make up the human body.\nLike anatomists, physiologists typically specialize in a particular branch of physiology. For example, neurophysiology\nis the study of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves and how these work together to perform functions as complex and\ndiverse as vision, movement, and thinking. Physiologists may work from the organ level (exploring, for example,\nwhat different parts of the brain do) to the molecular level (such as exploring how an electrochemical signal travels\nalong nerves).\nForm is closely related to function in all living things. For example, the thin flap of your eyelid can snap down to clear\naway dust particles and almost instantaneously slide back up to allow you to see again. At the microscopic level, the\narrangement and function of the nerves and muscles that serve the eyelid allow for its quick action and retreat. At a\nsmaller level of analysis, the function of these nerves and muscles likewise relies on the interactions of specific\nmolecules and ions. Even the three-dimensional structure of certain molecules is essential to their function.\nYour study of anatomy and physiology will make more sense if you continually relate the form of the structures you\nare studying to their function. In fact, it can be somewhat frustrating to attempt to study anatomy without an\nunderstanding of the physiology that a body structure supports. Imagine, for example, trying to appreciate the\nunique arrangement of the bones of the human hand if you had no conception of the function of the hand.\nFortunately, your understanding of how the human hand manipulates tools—from pens to cell phones—helps you\nappreciate the unique alignment of the thumb in opposition to the four fingers, making your hand a structure that\nallows you to pinch and grasp objects and type text messages.', 'The\ncustom version can be made available to students in\nlow-cost print or digital form through their campus\nbookstore.

The development choices for this textbook\nwere guided by hundreds of faculty who are deeply\ninvolved in teaching this course, as well as instructional\ndesigners, academic success experts, and educational\nresearchers who have supported A&P educators and\nstudents. These choices led to innovations in art,\nterminology, career orientation, practical applications,\nand multimedia-based learning, all with a goal of\nincreasing relevance to students. We strove to make\nthe discipline engaging and relevant to students, so\nthat they can draw from it a working knowledge that\nwill enrich their future studies and support them in\ntheir careers.\nUnit 1: Levels of Organization\nChapters 1–4 provide students with a basic\nunderstanding of human anatomy and physiology,\nincluding its language, the levels of organization, and\nthe basics of chemistry and cell biology.

When blood glucose levels rise after eating, insulin is released to facilitate the uptake of glucose by cells, thereby lowering blood sugar levels. Conversely, when glucose levels are low, insulin secretion decreases, allowing blood sugar levels to rise.","Insulin helps to regulate glucose levels in the blood by facilitating the uptake of glucose by cells, thereby lowering blood glucose levels."
